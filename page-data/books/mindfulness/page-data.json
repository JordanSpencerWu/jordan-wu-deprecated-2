This is what emotions are; they're like a background color that's created when your mind fuses together all of your thoughts, feelings, impulses and bodily sensations to conjure up an overall guiding theme or state of mind.</p>\n<p>The evidence is clear; brooding is the problem, not the solution.</p>\n<p>Changing your perspective can transform your experience of life, but if you rely solely on outside circumstances changing in order to feel happy and energized, you'll have to wait a very long time.</p>\n<p>Being mode: You can change your internal landscape the mindscape irrespective of what's happening around you.</p>\n<p>Mindful awareness - or mindfulness - spontaneously arises out of this Being mode when we earn to pay attention, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgement, to things as they actually are.</p>\n<p>The very foundation of mindful awareness: waking up to what's happening inside of you, and in the world, moment by moment.</p>\n<p>Meaningful work, whether paid or unpaid, is a surefire way of boosting happiness.</p>\n<p>Train yourself to notice when your autopilot is taking over, so that you can then make a choice about what you want your mind to be focusing upon.</p>\n<p>Relearn how to bring awareness to everyday activities so that you can see life as it is, unfolding moment by moment.</p>\n<p>None of us can control what thoughts rampage through our minds, or the \"weather\" they can create. But we do have some control over how we relate to it.</p>\n<p>We can easily spend so much time \"in our head\" that we almost forget we have a body at all.</p>\n<p>To cultivate mindfulness truly, we need to become fully integrated with our body once more.</p>\n<p>Happiness is looking at the same things with different eyes.</p>\n<p>The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself.</p>\n<p>If you do things in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you there by activate the mind's \"approach\" system: your life has a chance to become richer, warmer, more flexible and more creative.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is about reorienting your life, so you can enjoy it to the full.</p>\n<p>You don't have to change much of what you do from day to day, but instead learn to do the same things differently; to surround your tasks with the fresh air of awareness and choice.</p>\n<p>Our thoughts are like rumors in the mind.
