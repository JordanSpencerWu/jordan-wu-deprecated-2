With that knowledge comes the responsibility to act.</p>\n<p>The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren't responsible for the imperfections. As an aspiring professional, the first thing you must practice is apologizing. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero.</p>\n<p>A true professional knows that delivering function at the expense of structure is a fool's errand. It is the structure of your code that allow it to be flexible. If you compromise the structure, you compromise the future.</p>\n<p>Professionals spend time caring for their profession. Professionals practice. True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of every software professional to understand the domain of the solutions they are programming.</p>\n<p>Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers. The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest. The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes.</p>\n<p>A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own responsibilities as well as possible.</p>\n<p>When we say we will commit to something, and we need to mean it. The real truth is that you, personally, ALWAYS have something that's under your control, so there is always something you can fully commit to doing.</p>\n<p>Remember if you don't tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you're not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment.</p>\n<p>Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them. However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make \"yes\" possible.</p>\n<p>Professional developers allocate their personal time in order to ensure that the time spent at the office is as productive as possible.</p>\n<p>The professional attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful.</p>\n<p>Regularly measure your progress against your goals and come up with three fact-based end dates: best case, nominal case, and worst case.</p>\n<p>You should not agree to work overtime unless 1) you can personally afford it, 2) it is short term, two weeks or less, and 3) your boss has a fallback plan in case the overtime effort fails.</p>\n<h5>Three Laws of Test Driven Development TDD</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is one of the most powerful benefits of TDD. When you have a suite of tests that you trust, then you lose all fear of making changes. When programmers lost the fear of cleaning, they clean!</p>\n<p>TDD is the professional option, it is a discipline that enhances certainty, courage, defect reduction, documentation, and design.</p>\n<p>Professional programmers practice on their own time.</p>\n<p>Business people want to know exactly what they are going to get before they authorize a project. Developers want to know exactly what they are supposed to deliver before they estimate the project.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of professional developers and stakeholders to make sure that all ambiguity is removed from the requirement. Acceptance test are tests written by a collaboration of the stakeholders and the programmers in order to define when a requirement is done.</p>\n<p>Acceptance test should always be automated. Professionals’ developers take responsibility for their part in ensuring that acceptance test are automated.</p>\n<p>Professional developers have a single definition of done: Done means done. Done means all code written, all tests pass, QA and the stakeholder have accepted.</p>\n<p>Professional evaluate the priority of each task, disregarding their personal fears and desires, and execute those tasks in priority order.</p>\n<p>Software professionals are diligent in the management of their time and their focus.</p>\n<p>Professionals draw a clear distinction between estimates and commitments. They do not commit unless they know for certain they will succeed. They are careful not to make any implied commitments.</p>\n<p>Professionals will always help the business find a way to achieve its goals. But professionals do not necessarily accept commitments made by the business.</p>\n<p>When the going gets tough, trust your disciplines.</p>\n<p>A craftsman is someone who works quickly, but without rushing, who provides reasonable estimates and meet commitments. A craftsman knows when to say no, but tries hard to say yes. Craftsmanship is a meme that contains value, disciplines, techniques, attitudes, and answer.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Robert C.
