Everything flows out of motives and motivation - they are the root of our deepest desires.</p>\n<p>Character, what you are, is ultimately more important than competence, what you can do.</p>\n<p>Courage and consideration are the key building blocks of emotional maturity, and that emotional maturity is foundational to all decisions and all relationships.</p>\n<p>Emotional maturity is the ability to express your feeling and convictions with courage, balanced with consideration for the feelings and conviction of others.</p>\n<p>The key to primary greatness is to be centered on principles.</p>\n<p>Building character and quality of life is a function of aligning our beliefs and behaviors with universal principles.</p>\n<p>North star is universal, timeless, and self-evident.</p>\n<p>Four Human Endowment: self-awareness, conscience, independent will, and creative imagination.</p>\n<p>Basic human needs: to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy.</p>\n<p>We are the product of our choices.</p>\n<p>A life of total integrity is the only one worth striving for.</p>\n<p>Personal integrity account - the amount of trust we have in ourselves, in our ability to walk our talk.</p>\n<p>Without alignment behind the same vision, and without being tried into the same value system based on principles, everything else gets messed up.</p>\n<p>Our beliefs about the world determine how we behave.</p>\n<p>When people cultivate an abundance mentality, they will think win-win. They will develop more self-respect and respect for others and show tremendous compassion and tenderness toward others.</p>\n<h3>12 LEVERS OF SUCCESS</h3>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF INTEGRITY</h4>\n<p>It's about centering your life on the principle of total integrity.</p>\n<p>Integrity is the child of two primary character traits: humility and courage.</p>\n<p>Integrity means that your life is integrated around principles and that your security comes from within, not from with-out.</p>\n<p>Maintaining \"the highest levels of honesty and credibility in all relationships.\"</p>\n<p>Each of us is a composite of three selves: the public self, the private self, and our deep, secret self.</p>\n<p>If you reveal authentically who you are deep down, people will learn to trust you for your genuineness.</p>\n<p>We judge others by their behavior, ourselves by our intentions.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF CONTRIBUTION</h4>\n<p>Primary greatness is achieved by those who have a mission, a purpose to serve that is higher than themselves, a lasting contribution to make.</p>\n<p>Two side of leadership:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The private victory is the victory over self.</li>\n<li>The public victory is to get others to join you in the quest to achieve a shared vision.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF PRIORITY</h4>\n<p>The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.</p>\n<p>Your unique talents and capabilities determine the important work you have to do in life.</p>\n<p>I will not be governed by the efficiency of the clock; I will be governed by the compass of my conscience.</p>\n<p>People both want and need to feel that their lives and work have meaning.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF SACRIFICE</h4>\n<p>Synergy - the miracle that happens when everyone contributes their best thinking and nobody cares about getting credit.</p>\n<p>\"I will be open and listen to you and see what we can create together for our mutual benefit.\"</p>\n<p>You can only bond with people.</p>\n<p>Sacrifice is the very essence of bonding.</p>\n<p>Be more open and honest in your communication with no hidden agendas.</p>\n<p>The key to transformational partnerships is the willingness to sacrifice an old mindset and skillset and to move to the new mindset of interdependency and the new skillset of synergy, seeking first to understand while always looking for mutual benefit.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF SERVICE</h4>\n<p>The giving of the self.</p>\n<p>The key to the many is the one.</p>\n<p>The deepest hunger of the human soul is to be recognized, valued, appreciated, and understood.</p>\n<p>The cultivation of the spirit of servant leadership will teach everyone to be kind, respectful, and caring.</p>\n<p>The connection between the way employees are treated and how they treat customers.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF RESPONSIBILITY</h4>\n<p>Our quality of our life depends on our own choices.</p>\n<p>What makes you beautiful and lovely - your willingness to be open and authentic.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF LOYALTY</h4>\n<p>Be loyal to people who are absent.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF RECIPROCITY</h4>\n<p>What you give comes back to you.</p>\n<p>The roots of your problems are in your character, and so are the root solutions.</p>\n<p>Build your character and your relationships on the bedrock of principles.</p>\n<p>Reciprocal relationship provides a healthy return on investment.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF DIVERSITY</h4>\n<p>Without diversity, there is no synergy and, without synergy, nothing new happens.</p>\n<p>At the root of the ability to fully value and celebrate difference in others is having your own personal security tied to a shared vision, common purpose, and integrity based on principles.</p>\n<p>If we share a transcending purpose, common vision, and shared mission in our relationships, we can afford to have many differences, and they'll become strengths.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF LEARNING</h4>\n<p>The love of learning and the search for wisdom help make life worthwhile.</p>\n<p>We all have an obligation to learn and progress.</p>\n<p>Security lies in the power to continually learn.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF RENEWAL</h4>\n<p>You can't achieve primary greatness by neglecting yourself - your health, your mind, your emotional and spiritual life.</p>\n<p>The ultimate personal synergy comes when we renew ourselves in physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions regularly, on both personal and professional levels.</p>\n<h4>THE LEVER OF TEACHING</h4>\n<p>Teach them to others.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>\n<p>Three roles for every learner:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Capturing or understanding essential information.</li>\n<li>Expanding or applying this knowledge into his own life for his own purposes and values.</li>\n<li>Teaching others for their benefit and growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How to capture learning: purpose, main points, validation, application, and value.</p>\n<p>Applying this simple concept of teaching what you learn will pay big dividends.</p>\n<p>Wisdom - a perspective that embraces principles, continuous growth, and an integrated wholeness. It is a perspective that bring peace to the inner person and prosperity to the world. It is perspective that brings security because the principle upon which we live our lives are solid, enduring, and will never change.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Stephen R.
