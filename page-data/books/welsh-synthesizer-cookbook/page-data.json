By changing the width of a pulse, it is possible to change its harmonic content.</p>\n<p>Syncing is the ability to sync one oscillator to the other. For syncing to have any effect on the sound the synced oscillator must be tuned higher than the master oscillator. The slave must be tuned higher but if it is tuned at octave intervals syncing will have no effect.</p>\n<p>White noise maintains uniform power across all frequencies.</p>\n<p>Pink noise diminishes in power by 3 dB per octave.</p>\n<p>Brown noise diminishes in power by 6 dB per octave.</p>\n<p>Keyboard pitch tracking allows the user to select whether or not the pitch of an oscillator will change as different keys are played.</p>\n<p>Filter cutoff keyboard tracking is used to either gradually increase or decrease the amount of filtering that take place as keys are played either up or down the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Keyboard tracking can be used to modify envelop times and amounts.</p>\n<p>Polyphony refers to the number of keys that can be played and still produce sound.</p>\n<p>Synthesizers that only allow one note to be played at a time are called monophonic while synthesizers that allow multiple notes are polyphonic.</p>\n<p>Portamento, also known as glide, will cause the pitch to change gradually between two consecutively struck keys.</p>\n<p>Unison is used to create a chorusing-like effect.</p>\n<p>One pole is 6 dB</p>\n<p>Two poles are 12 dB</p>\n<p>Four poles are 24 dB</p>\n<p>Whenever frequencies are removed from a signal they no longer contribute to the overall power of the signal. Removing frequencies will result in an overall lower amplitude.</p>\n<p>To add vibrato or tremolo to a patch an LFO would be used to modulate the pitch and amplitude respectively.</p>\n<p>Sine and triangle waves are the most ideal for imitating natural effects such as vibrato and tremolo.</p>\n<p>LFOs can also be used to create rhythm. This is where the square and sawtooth sources become the most useful. Using either one of these sources and routing the LFO to modulate the amplitude or filter cutoff frequency can result in useful gating effects.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Fred Welsh"],"seo_description":"Welsh's synthesizer cookbook by Fred Welsh notes.","title":"Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/welsh-synthesizer-cookbook/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
