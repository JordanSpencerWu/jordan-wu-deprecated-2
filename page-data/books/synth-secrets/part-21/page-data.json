Likewise, if a polyphonic synth has switches that select between preset patches, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Similarly, if a polyphonic synth has user-programmable memories, it too contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Therefore, a totally analogue polysynth can only be one that offers total polyphony provided by independent articulators for each note, and which has no presets and no memories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In mainstream synthesis, there have only ever been two totally analogue polysynths: the Korg PS3100 and PS3300.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"author":["Gordon Reid"],"seo_description":"From Polyphony To Digital Synths","title":"From Polyphony To Digital Synths"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/synth-secrets/part-21/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
