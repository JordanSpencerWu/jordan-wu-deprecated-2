The first is the pitch CV; it helps to determine the pitch of the sound produced, for any given key. The second is the Trigger. This is a pulse of short duration that, at the exact moment you press a key, can trigger the actions of devices such as transient generators. The third is the Gate. Like the Trigger, the Gate's leading edge tells other parts of the synth that you have pressed a key. However the Gate remains 'Open' for the whole time that you depress the key. This means that it can also tell the rest of the synth the exact moment that you release the key.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although a Trigger will initiate a transient generator, it's the Gate that tells the synth to continue developing the contour until the key is released. Without a Gate, all you would hear would be a short 'blip' at the start of the sound, but nothing thereafter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you hear a sound, your brain uses just the first few milliseconds to ascertain what instrument is producing it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to recreate acoustic sounds or program interesting synthesizer sounds deterministically then, at the very least, you must be able to analyse and create the brightness and loudness contours of the sound.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"author":["Gordon Reid"],"seo_description":"Envelopes, Gates & Triggers","title":"Envelopes, Gates & Triggers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/synth-secrets/part-7/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
