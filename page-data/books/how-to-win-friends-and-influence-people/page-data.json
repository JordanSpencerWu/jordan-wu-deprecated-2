Everyone thinks differently, there's no need to criticize, condemn or complain about others. Remember people only see the world in their point of veiw and in their world they are the good guys. These actions will not makes things better and will make people hate you more!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Give honest and sincere appreciation</h3>\n<p>There is only one way to get anybody to do anything and that is by making the other person want to do it. Human biggest urge is the \"the desire to be important\" and are craving to be appreciated. This desire to be important will make people strive to be great and giving appreciation will make them feel important. Avoid flattery!! Acknowledge others accomplishments and efforts by giving honest, sincere appreciation.</p>\n<h3>Arouse in the other person an eager want</h3>\n<p>Everyone has their own wants and it differs from ours. The only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Remember that everyone thinks about themselves more than anything in the world, we can use that to our advantage. Before you persuade somebody to do something, take a moment and ask yourself: \"How can I make this person want to do it?\". An increased tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle will make you successful in life. A individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the working of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Ways to Make People Like You</h2>\n<h3>Become genuinely interested in other people</h3>\n<p>Most people can talk about themselves for hours!!! They all want to talk about their unique stories and what they like to do. You can learn a lot from listening to others! Next time you see someone think about all the things you might learn from listening.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Smile</h3>\n<p>Well this is a no brainer a smile is worth a million dollars!! I am talking about a real smile, a smile that comes from within. There are going to be times in you life where it is hard to smile, but remember smiling brings happiness to you and others around you!!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language</h3>\n<p>Everyone is important and the only way to distinguish them from others is by remembering their name. Their name is a unique identifier and it's important to everyone!! Most people don't use the time and energy to remember names, don't be those people!!</p>\n<h3>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves</h3>\n<p>Being a good listener is always better than being a good talker!! Everyone has their own unique stories and they all want a good listener. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.</p>\n<h3>Talk in terms of the other person's interests</h3>\n<p>Everyone has hobbies and interests!! They will be more interested in you if you show curiosity in their hobbies and interests. We are curiosity creatures and having a diversity of knowledge will only make us more interesting to others. Remember talking in terms of the other person's interests pays off for both parties.</p>\n<h3>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely</h3>\n<p>Remember everyone is important, help remind people of that! Give sincere compliments and honest appreciation to others. We are all in this together and helping each other achieve the desire to be important will bring happiness to the world around us.</p>\n<h2>How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h2>\n<h3>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it</h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to be right and will strive to justify that. If correcting someone will make them hate you, why would you want to do that? Never question ones intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect! Avoid arguments at all cost, there's never a winner and it will only hurt both parties sense of pride. Remember to ask yourself: \"What will you gain and lose from winning the argument?\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,\" and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's viewpoint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, \"You're wrong.\"</h3>\n<p>Everyone learns and understand things differently. We make mistakes in life, but we can learn from them. It's important to help people recognize that they might be wrong by reminding them of a common human feature of making mistakes. Never tell someone they are wrong, instead work together to find the right. By working together you can see their point of view and understand why they might see something differently. Remember there's never a wrong answer!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically</h3>\n<p>Let's be honest with ourselves and know that we aren't always right. Admitting that you were wrong will allow others to understand your point of view and how you thought it was right. It's ok to be wrong, no one is perfect!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any fool can try and defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exualtaion to admit one's mistake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Begin in a friendly way</h3>\n<p>Start by being friendly towards others, this display of friendliness will get others to agree with you. People are more likely to cooperate with you if you work alongside with them.</p>\n<h3>Get the other person saying \"yes, yes\" immediately</h3>\n<p>The best way to talk to people is not by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing and keep on emphasizing, the things on which you agree. The goal is to get the \"yes\" response, this helps in understanding each others wants and needs.</p>\n<h3>Let the other person do a great deal of the talking</h3>\n<p>Let's remember that people like to talk about themselves! When your friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they might feel inferior and envious. It's best to let them talk about themselves and we can be the good listener.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friend excel you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers</h3>\n<p>We have more faith in ideas that we discover for ourself than in the ideas of others. It's best to make suggestions and let the other person think out the conclusion. We want them to agree with us and if we give them suggestions, they can decided whether or not they agree with our idea.</p>\n<h3>Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view</h3>\n<p>We only see the world from our own point of view. This view is different in others, instead of viewing the world in one perceptive let's expand our view to others. Try honestly to put youself in his or her place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don't think so. Don't condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires</h3>\n<p>Most people you meet in your life want sympathy, give it to them, and they will love you.</p>\n<p>'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.</p>\n<h3>Appeal to the nobler motives</h3>\n<p>There will be times where both parties must compromise on an agreement. When both parties fully understand each others point of view, they will be honest and fair on an agreement.</p>\n<h3>Dramatize your ideas</h3>\n<p>One way to get people to recognize your ideas is to dramatize it. Doing something out of the ordinary will get people's attention.</p>\n<h3>Throw down a challenge</h3>\n<p>If nothing else works, throw down a challenge!! People love challenges, the chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.</p>\n<h2>Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin with praise and honest appreciation</li>\n<li>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly</li>\n<li>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person</li>\n<li>Ask question instead of giving direct orders</li>\n<li>Let the other person save face</li>\n<li>Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.
