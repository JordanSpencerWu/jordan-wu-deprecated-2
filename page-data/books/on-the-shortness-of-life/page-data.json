Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.</p>\n<p>So, it is - the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.</p>\n<p>You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals.</p>\n<p>It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and - what will perhaps make you wonder more - it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.</p>\n<p>he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.</p>\n<p>Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing - nay, of almost no value at all.</p>\n<p>no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing.</p>\n<p>Postponement is the greatest waste of life; it deprives them of each day as it comes, it snatches from them the present by promising something hereafter.</p>\n<p>The greatest hindrance to loving is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes today.</p>\n<p>\"Why are you idle? Unless you seize the day, it flees.\"</p>\n<p>Life is divided into three periods - that which has been, that which is, that which will be. Of these the present time is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain.</p>\n<p>He makes his life long by combining all times into one.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Seneca"],"seo_description":"On the shortness of life by Seneca notes.","title":"On The Shortness Of Life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/on-the-shortness-of-life/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
