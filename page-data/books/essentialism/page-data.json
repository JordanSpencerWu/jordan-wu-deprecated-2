This involves learning to tell the difference, learning to filter through all those options and selecting only those that are truly essential. It's not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.</p>\n<p>Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The pursuit of success can be a catalyst for failure, in other words, success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decision deteriorates.</p>\n<p>We live in a world almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.</p>\n<p>As painful as they can sometime be, trade-offs represent a significant opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome we want.</p>\n<p>The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves.</p>\n<p>Essential intent applies to so much than your job description or your company's mission statement; a true essential intent is one that guides your greater senese of purpose, and helps you chart your life's path.</p>\n<p>The life of an Essentialist is a life of meaning. It is a life that really matters.</p>\n<p>Once you become an Essentialist, you will find that you aren't like everybody else. When other people are saying yes, you will find yourself saying no. When other people are doing, you will find yourself thinking. When other people are speaking, you will find yourself listening. When other people are in the spotlight, vying for attention, you will find yourself waiting on the sidelines until it is time to shine. While other people are padding their resumes and building out their LinkedIn profiles, you will be building a career of meaning. While other people are complaining about how busy they are, you will just be smiling sympathetically, unable to relate. While other people are living a life of stress and chaos, you will be living a life of impact and fulfillment. In many ways, to live as an Essentialist in our too many things all the time society is an act of quiet revolution.</p>\n<h5>Essentialist</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>\"I choose to.\"</li>\n<li>Thinks almost everything is nonessential</li>\n<li>Distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many</li>\n<li>Asks, \"What is the trade-off I want to make?\"</li>\n<li>Asks, \"What can I go big on?\"</li>\n<li>Creates space to escape and explore life</li>\n<li>Pays attention to the signal in the noise</li>\n<li>Hears what is not being said</li>\n<li>Scans to find the essence of the information</li>\n<li>Knows play is essential</li>\n<li>Knows play sparks exploration</li>\n<li>One hour more of sleep equals several more hours of much higher productivity</li>\n<li>Sleep is for high performers</li>\n<li>Sleep is a priority</li>\n<li>Sleep breeds creativity</li>\n<li>Sleep enables the highest level of mental contribution</li>\n<li>Says yes to only the top 10 percent of opportunities</li>\n<li>Uses narrow, explicit criteria like \"Is this exactly what I am looking for?\"</li>\n<li>Has a strategy that is concrete and inspirational</li>\n<li>Has an intent that is both meaningful and memorable</li>\n<li>Makes one decision that eliminates one thousand later decisions</li>\n<li>Dares to say no firmly, resolutely, and gracefully</li>\n<li>Says yes only to the things that really matter</li>\n<li>Asks, \"If I weren't already invested in this project, how much would I invest in it now?\"</li>\n<li>Thinks, \"What else could I do with this time or money if I pulled the plug now?\"</li>\n<li>Comfortable with cutting loses</li>\n<li>Thinks that making things better means subtracting something</li>\n<li>Eliminates the distracting words, images, and details</li>\n<li>Knows that if you have limits you will become limitless</li>\n<li>Sees boundaries as liberating</li>\n<li>Sets rules in advance that eliminate the need for the direct \"no\"</li>\n<li>Builds in a buffer for unexpected events</li>\n<li>Practices extreme and early preparation</li>\n<li>Remove obstacles to progress</li>\n<li>Brings forth more</li>\n<li>Starts small and gets big results</li>\n<li>Celebrates small acts of progress</li>\n<li>Design a routine that enshrines what is essential, making execution almost effortless</li>\n<li>Makes the essential the default position</li>\n<li>Mind is focused on the present</li>\n<li>Tunes in to what is important right now</li>\n<li>Enjoys the moment</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"author":["Greg McKeown"],"seo_description":"Essentialism - the disciplined pursuit of less by Greg McKeown notes.","title":"Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/essentialism/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
