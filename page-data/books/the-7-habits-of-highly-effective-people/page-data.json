To know and not do is really not to know.</p>\n<p>It is character that communicates most eloquently.</p>\n<p>What we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do.</p>\n<p>There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character.</p>\n<p>\"Inside-out\" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self - with your paradigms, your character, and your motives.</p>\n<p>The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others.</p>\n<p>\"Sow a thought and you reap an action; sow an act and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap a character; sow a character and you reap a destiny.\"</p>\n<p>Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence.</p>\n<p>Dependence is the paradigm of you.</p>\n<p>Independence is the paradigm of I.</p>\n<p>Interdependent is the paradigm of we.</p>\n<p>Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make.</p>\n<p>Private victories precede public victories.</p>\n<p>The techniques and skills that really make a difference in human interaction are the ones that almost naturally flow from a truly independent character.</p>\n<p>As we become independent - proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organized and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity - we then can choose to become interdependent - capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.</p>\n<p>When we truly love others without condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity, and integrity.</p>\n<p>It's about transactional to transformational.</p>\n<h5>Habit 1: Be Proactive</h5>\n<p>Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.</p>\n<p>The habit of proactivity. It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives.</p>\n<p>Responsibility - the ability to choose your response.</p>\n<p>\"No one can hurt you without your consent.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.\"</p>\n<p>Love is a verb. Love is something you do; the sacrifices you make, the giving of self.</p>\n<p>By working on ourselves instead of worrying about conditions, we were able to influence the conditions.</p>\n<p>The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control problems involving our own behavior; indirect control problems involving other people's behavior; or no control problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities.</p>\n<p>Direct control problems problems involving our own behavior are solved by working on our habits. These are the \"Private Victories\" of Habit 1, 2, and 3.</p>\n<p>Indirect control problems problems involving other people's behavior are solved by changing our methods of influence. These are the \"Public Victories\" of Habit 4, 5, and 6.</p>\n<p>Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about.</p>\n<p>Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control.</p>\n<p>\"Lord, give me the courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference.\"</p>\n<p>While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.</p>\n<p>\"When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other.\"</p>\n<p>The commitments we make and keep to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.</p>\n<p>The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.</p>\n<p>It is not what other do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most, it is our response to those things.</p>\n<p>It is here that we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. We can make a promise - and keep it. Or we can set a goal - and work to achieve it.</p>\n<h5>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</h5>\n<p>To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination.</p>\n<p>How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.</p>\n<p>Find your definition of success.</p>\n<p>\"Begin with the end in mind.\" is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things.</p>\n<p>Habit 1 say, \"You are the creator.\" Habit 2 is the first creation.</p>\n<p>Habit 2 is based on principle of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first creation.</p>\n<p>There's two parts, personal leadership first creation and management second creation.</p>\n<p>\"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\"</p>\n<p>I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my memory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past. I can become my own first creator.</p>\n<p>Develop a personal mission statement focusing on what you want to be <strong>character</strong> and to do <strong>contributions and achievements</strong>.</p>\n<p>The key to the ability to change is changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value.</p>\n<p>Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity.</p>\n<p>Circle of Influence is the center of our life and will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power.</p>\n<p>Victory over self is the foundation for rich, interdependent relationships.</p>\n<p>By centering our lives on correct principles, we create a solid foundation for development of security, guidance, wisdom, and power.</p>\n<p>Your paradigm is the source from which your attitudes and behavior flow.</p>\n<p>Our meaning comes from within.</p>\n<p>An understanding of the principle of our own growth enables us to search out correct principles with the confidence that the more we learn, the more clearly, we can focus the lens through which we see the world.</p>\n<h5>Habit 3: Put First Things First</h5>\n<p>Habit 3 is the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-center.</p>\n<p>Time management: organize and execute around priorities.</p>\n<p>Time management has two factors that define an activity are urgent and important.</p>\n<p>Quadrant II not urgent but important is the heart of effective personal management.</p>\n<p>80 precent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities.</p>\n<p>The enemy of the \"best\" is often the \"good\".</p>\n<p>Management follows leadership.</p>\n<p>Effective management is putting first things first.</p>\n<p>Organize and execute around priorities.</p>\n<p>The heart of effective personal management is to deal with things that are not urgent, but are important.</p>\n<p>Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identifying Roles</li>\n<li>Selecting Goals for Each Role</li>\n<li>Scheduling</li>\n<li>Daily Adapting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Trust is the highest form of human motivation.</p>\n<p>\"There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.\"</p>\n<p>Effective interdependence can only be built on a foundation of true independence.</p>\n<p>Self-mastery and self-discipline are the foundation of good relationships with other.</p>\n<p>Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence.</p>\n<p>The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but what we are.</p>\n<p>As we become independent, proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organize and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity. We then can choose to become interdependent, capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.</p>\n<p>Building and repairing relationships are long-term investments.</p>\n<p>When we truly love others without condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity, and integrity.</p>\n<h5>Habit 4: Think WIN-WIN</h5>\n<p>The moment you step from independence into interdependence in any capacity, you step into a leadership role. You are in a position of influencing other people. And the habit of effective interpersonal leadership is Think Win/Win.</p>\n<p>Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seek mutual benefit in all human interactions.</p>\n<p>Win/Win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It's not your way or my way; it's a better way, a higher way.</p>\n<p>Win/Win or No Deal</p>\n<p>Anything less than Win/Win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>The stronger you are. The more genuine your character, the higher your level of proactivity, the more committed you really are to Win/Win. The more powerful your influence will be with that other person.</p>\n<p>Win/Win is a paradigm of human interaction.</p>\n<p>Win/Win comes from a character of integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality.</p>\n<h5>Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood</h5>\n<p>Seek first to understand, then to be understood. This principle is the key to effective interpersonal communication.</p>\n<p>To influence me, you first need to understand me.</p>\n<p>The real key to your influence is your character or the kind of person you truly are.</p>\n<p>Unless you're influenced by my uniqueness. I'm not going to be influenced by your advice.</p>\n<p>You have to build the skills of empathic listening on a base of character that inspires openness and trust.</p>\n<p>In order to have influence, you have to be influenced.</p>\n<p>Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.</p>\n<p>empathic listening means listening with intent to understand.</p>\n<p>The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it's that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually.</p>\n<p>The key to good judgement is understanding.</p>\n<p>The time you invest to deeply understand the people you love brings tremendous dividends in open communication.</p>\n<p>When you listen, you learn.</p>\n<p>Seek first to understand. Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, before you try to present your own ideas - seek to understand.</p>\n<p>When we really, deeply understand each other, we open the door to creative solutions and third alternatives.</p>\n<h5>Habit 6: SYNERGIZE</h5>\n<p>Synergy is the essence of principle-centered leadership.</p>\n<p>It catalyzes, unifies, and unleashes the greatest powers within people.</p>\n<p>Synergy means that the whole is greater than the sum of its part.</p>\n<p>The essence of synergy is to value differences - to respect them, to build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy - the mental, the emotional, the psychological difference between people.</p>\n<p>When you communicate synergistically, you are simply opening your mind and heart and expressions to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options.</p>\n<p>Synergy effectiveness in an independent reality, it is teamwork, team building, the development of unity and creativity with other human beings.</p>\n<p>The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds of other human beings.</p>\n<p>There's almost always a third alternative, and if you work with a Win/Win philosophy and really seek to understand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for everyone concerned.</p>\n<h5>Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw</h5>\n<p>It's about renewing the four dimensions of your nature - physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional.</p>\n<p>The single most powerful investment we can ever make in life, investment in ourselves.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Stephen R.
