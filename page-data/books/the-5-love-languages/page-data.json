When a child really feels loved, he will develop normally, but when the love thank is empty, the child will misbehave. Much of the misbehavior of children is motivated by the craving of an empty 'love tank'.\"</p>\n<p>The euphoria of the \"in-love\" state give us the illusion that we have an intimate relationship.</p>\n<p>\"Real love\" to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees in me something worth loving.</p>\n<p>Verbal compliments, or words of appreciation, are powerful communiactors of love.</p>\n<p>The latent potential within your spouse in his or her area of insecurity may await your encouraging words.</p>\n<p>Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective.</p>\n<p>Mature love - love to which we aspire if we seek a growing marriage.</p>\n<p>Forgiveness is the way of love.</p>\n<p>Forgiveness is an expression of love. \"I love you. I care about you, and I choose to forgive you. Even though my feelings of hurt may linger, I will not allow what has happened to come between us. I hope that we can learn from this experience. You are not a failure because you have failed.
