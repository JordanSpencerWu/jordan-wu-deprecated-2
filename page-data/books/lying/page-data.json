They tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining that they are being good in the process.</p>\n<p>We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy.</p>\n<p>The endless forms of suffering and embarrassment could be easily avoided by simply telling the truth.</p>\n<p>To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.</p>\n<p>To speak truthfully is to accurately represent one's beliefs.</p>\n<p>The intent to communicate honestly is the measure of truthfulness.</p>\n<p>We know that trust is deeply rewarding and that deception and suspicion are two side of the same coin.</p>\n<p>Honest people are a refuge: You know they mean what they say; you know they will not say one thing to your face and another behind your back; you know they will tell you when they think you have failed and for this reason their praise cannot be mistaken for mere flattery.</p>\n<p>Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding, these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs, whether or not our lies are ever discovered.</p>\n<p>False encouragement is a kind of theft: It steal time, energy, and motivation that a person would put toward some other purpose.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest problems for the liar is that he must keep track of his lies. When you tell the truth, you have nothing to keep track of.</p>\n<p>To lie is to erect a boundary between the truth we are living and the perception others have of us.</p>\n<p>Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understand.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Sam Harris"],"seo_description":"Lying by Sam Harris notes.","title":"Lying"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/lying/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
