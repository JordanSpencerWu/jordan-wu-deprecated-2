And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.</p>\n<p>The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right.</p>\n<p>If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy.</p>\n<p>The quality of your life is the quality of your questions.</p>\n<p>The reason you're suffering is you're focused on yourself.</p>\n<p>If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.</p>\n<p>Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.</p>\n<p>The biggest mistake you can make is to accept the norms of your time.</p>\n<p>Remember who you are.</p>\n<p>Be the silence that listens.</p>\n<p>Don't force it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to stop doing things you love in order to nurture the one thing that matters most.</p>\n<p>Truth is, young creative minds don't need more ideas, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they've already got.</p>\n<p>The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials.</p>\n<p>Discipline equals freedom.</p>\n<p>There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way.</p>\n<p>What you seek is seeking you.</p>\n<p>Consistency driven by a deep love of the work.</p>\n<p>Life is a continual process of arrival into who we are.</p>\n<p>Write to please just one person.</p>\n<p>You have to be prepared to fail. That's how you're going to expand yourself and grow. As you work through that process of failure and learning, you will really deepen into the human being you're capable of being.</p>\n<p>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.</p>\n<p>Perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.</p>\n<p>To blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair because, first of all, we don't understand ourselves, and even if we do understand ourselves, we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people. Therefore, to be furious and enraged and bitter that people don't get all of who we are is a really cruel piece of immaturity.</p>\n<p>The best art divides the audience.</p>\n<p>The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.</p>\n<p>The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>\n<p>Cynicism is a disease that robs people of the gift of life.</p>\n<p>Be yourself. Everyone else is taken.</p>\n<p>The most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It's just like building muscles.</p>\n<p>The first rule of handling conflict is don't hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.</p>\n<p>In any situation in life, you only have three options. You always have three options. You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it.</p>\n<p>Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.</p>\n<p>There are no adults. Everyone's making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.</p>\n<p>Be willing to fail or succeed on who you really are. Don't ever try to be anything else.</p>\n<p>The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs. It's the same thing - fear = but it's what you do with it that matters.</p>\n<p>When I had the opportunity, did I choose courage over comfort?</p>\n<p>Shame is 'I am a bad person.' Guilt is 'I did something bad.' Shame is a focus on self. Guilt is a focus on behavior.</p>\n<p>Don't go for funny. Go for the truth, and you'll hit funny along the way.</p>\n<p>Always tell the truth. It's the easiest thing to remember.</p>\n<p>Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage...</p>\n<p>You must want to be a butterfly so badly; you are willing to give up being a caterpillar.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Tim Ferriss"],"seo_description":"Tools of titans by Tim Ferriss notes.","title":"Tools Of Titans"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/tools-of-titans/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
