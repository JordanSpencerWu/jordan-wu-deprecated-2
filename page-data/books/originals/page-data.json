The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world.</p>\n<p>We crave acceptance by our peer group, those similar to us. We're also drawn to peer evaluations because they provide the most reliable judgements.</p>\n<p>To be successfully original, an invention needs to be new - but it also has to be practical.</p>\n<p>Intuition operates rapidly, based on hot emotions, whereas reason is a slower, cooler process.</p>\n<h4>Out on a Limb</h4>\n<p>Power involves exercising control or authority over others; status is being respected and admired.</p>\n<p>People were punished for trying to exercise power without status.</p>\n<p>If we want people to accept our original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>Exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it.</p>\n<p>If we could do things over, most of us would censor ourselves less and express our ideas more.</p>\n<h4>Fools Rush In</h4>\n<p>Procrastination might be conducive to originality.</p>\n<p>Delaying progress enabled people to spend more time considering different ways to accomplish it, rather than \"seizing and freezing\" on one particular strategy.</p>\n<p>Procrastination may be the enemy of productivity, but it can be a resource for creativity.</p>\n<p>People of \"genius sometimes accomplish most when they work the least, for they are thinking out inventions and forming in their minds the perfect idea.\"</p>\n<p>Zeigarnik effect: people have a better memory for incomplete than complete tasks.</p>\n<p>\"Timing accounted for forty-two percent of the difference between success and failure.</p>\n<p>Moving first is a tactic, not a goal, being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you.</p>\n<p>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.</p>\n<p>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go along.</p>\n<h4>Goldilocks and the Trojan Horse</h4>\n<p>\"It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feeling of strangeness and hostility between them.\"</p>\n<p>If you were a true believer, you'd be all in. The more strongly you identify with an extreme group, the harder you seek to differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values.</p>\n<p>In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics.</p>\n<p>If we want to inspire people, we should start with why.</p>\n<p>Frenemies - people who sometimes support you and sometimes undermine you.</p>\n<p>Cur our frenemies and attempt to convert our enemies.</p>\n<p>\"A person whose liking for us increases over time will be liked better than one who has always liked us.\"</p>\n<p>\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"</p>\n<h4>Rebel with a Cause</h4>\n<p>When we use the logic consequence, we can always find reasons not to take risk.</p>\n<p>The logic of appropriateness free us up. We think less about what will guarantee the outcome we want, and act more on a visceral sense of what someone like us ought to do.</p>\n<p>\"Firstborns are more risk averse than laterborns.\"</p>\n<p>Although firstborns tend to be more dominant, conscientious, and ambitious, laterborns are more open to taking risks and embracing original ideas.</p>\n<p>Niche picking helps to solve the mystery of why siblings aren't terribly similar; laterborn children actively seek to be different.</p>\n<p>Parents of highly creative children outlined their standards of conduct and explained their grounding in a set of principles about right and wrong, referencing values like morality, integrity, respect, curiosity, and perseverance.</p>\n<p>Character praise leaves a lasting imprint when identities are forming.</p>\n<h4>Rethinking Groupthink</h4>\n<p>Groupthink is the enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought.</p>\n<p>Groupthink occurs when people \"are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group,\" and their \"striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.\"</p>\n<p>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills.</p>\n<p>The star blueprint focus on placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires.</p>\n<p>The commitment blueprint main priority was to employ people who matched the company's values and norms.</p>\n<p>Strong culture has a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they're more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.</p>\n<p>\"Minority viewpoint are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't let loyalty stand in the way of truth and openness.\"</p>\n<p>\"Argue like you're right and listen like you're wrong.\"</p>\n<p>\"You gain believability by other believable people saying you're believable.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shapers\" are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious.</p>\n<h4>Rocking the Boat and Keeping It Steady</h4>\n<p>Strategic optimists anticipate the best, staying calm and setting high expectations.</p>\n<p>Defensive pessimists expect the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong.</p>\n<p>Fear is marked by uncertainty about the future: We're worried that something bad will happen.</p>\n<p>Originality brings more bumps in the road, yet it leaves us with more happiness and a greater sense of meaning.</p>\n<p>\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world, indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Adam Grant"],"seo_description":"Originals - how non-conformists move the world forward by Adam Grant notes.","title":"Originals - How Non-Conformists Move The World Forward"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/originals/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
