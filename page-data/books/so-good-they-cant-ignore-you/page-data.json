By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable.\"</p>\n<p>When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.</p>\n<h3>RULE #4 Think Small, Act Big</h3>\n<p>great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using small and achievable projects - little bets - to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.</p>\n<p>career capital is necessary to identify a good mission.</p>\n<p>\"Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins.\"</p>\n<p>\"The world is full of boring stuff - brown cows - which is why so few people pay attention... A purple cow... now that would stand out. Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing.\"</p>\n<p>For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Cal Newport"],"seo_description":"So good they can't ignore you - why skills trump passion in the quest for work you love by Cal Newport notes.","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
