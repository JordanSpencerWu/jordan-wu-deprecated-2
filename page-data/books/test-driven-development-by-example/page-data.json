For <strong>obvious implementation</strong> means to type in the real implementation. Lastly, <strong>triangulation</strong> is used to get the code to compile quickly with a stub implementation and make the test work by typing in what seemed to be the right code.</p>\n<h5>3A Pattern</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Arrange - Create some objects</li>\n<li>Act - Stimulate them</li>\n<li>Assert - Check the results</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>TDD Patterns</h5>\n<p>Testing is a very important discipline in the software industry. Having test suites gives developers more confidence in making changes to the code base. This will reduce stress knowing that the changes made will not break the code base and reduces the number of errors. When writing or designing a test make sure the tests are independent from each other by decoupling them. By writing isolated tests, we can achieve high cohesion. Be sure to make a test list, write a list of all the tests you know you will have to write. Remember to test first, when we test first, we reduce the stress, which makes us more likely to test. Lastly, use data that makes the test easy to read and follow, you are writing tests for a reader.</p>\n<h5>Testing Patterns</h5>\n<p>When writing a test that is too big, try writing a smaller test case that represents the broken part of the bigger test case. When testing an object that relies on an expensive or complicated resource, create a mock object of the resource that answers constants. You may leave the last test broken when taking a break, this will allow you to think about what you wrote and help you continue finishing the test. Always make sure that all of the tests are running before you check in your code.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Kent Beck"],"seo_description":"Test-driven development - by example by Kent Beck notes.","title":"Test-Driven Development - By Example"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/test-driven-development-by-example/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
