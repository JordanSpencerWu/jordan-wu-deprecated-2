Perception is not something that happens to us, or in us. It is something we do.\"</p>\n<p>The world is known to us because we live and act in it, and accumulate experience.</p>\n<p>How we act is not determined in an isolated moment of choice; it is powerfully ordered by how we perceive the situation, how we are attuned to it, and this is very much a function of our previous history of shaping ourselves to the world in a particular way.</p>\n<p>Perceived risk increases conscious effort and focuses attention.</p>\n<p>The success of those engineering efforts offers good evidence that we are indeed situated being, formed in very consequential ways by our interactions with our environment.</p>\n<p>Enlightenment is \"man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity... [This immaturity consists not in a] lack of understanding, but lack of resolution and courage to use [one's own understanding] without the guidance of another. \"Further, laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large portion of men... remain immature for life.\"</p>\n<p>To live authentically, one has to \"divorce oneself from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that uncharted journey into the rebellious imperatives of the self.\"</p>\n<p>Joint Attention is thus intimately bound up with the capacity for communication, which requires not only awareness of the existence of other minds, but mutual awareness of a joint field of reference: the shared world.</p>\n<p>There is no self to be known that exists prior to, or at a \"deeper level\" than, the self that is in the world. This implies that individuality, too, is something that we achieve only in the through our dealings with others.</p>\n<p>We need other people as a check on our own self-understanding.</p>\n<p>What distinguishes human acts from mere events, and from animal doings, is that we are concerned with justification.</p>\n<p>Self-realization, and the ability to act by oneself.</p>\n<p>The project of becoming a grown-up demand that one brings one's conflicts to awareness; to intellectualize them and become articulate about them, rather than let them drive one's behavior stupidly.</p>\n<p>Ideal autonomy: the hope for a self that is not in conflict with the world.</p>\n<p>\"Attention is rewarded by a knowledge of reality.\"</p>\n<p>Learning how to think really means learning to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.</p>\n<p>The ability to direct our attention as we will is a basic condition for living well.</p>\n<p>Where strong emotions of sexual love, or of hatred, resentment, or jealousy are concerned, \"pure will\" can usually achieve little. It is small use telling oneself \"stop being in love, stop feeling resentment, be just.\" What is needed is a reorientation which will provide an energy of a different kind, from a different source. Notice the metaphors of orientation and of looking... Deliberately falling out of love is not a jump of the will, it is the acquiring of new object of attention and thus of new energies as a result of refocusing.</p>\n<p>New energies come from real objects that one becomes interested in.</p>\n<p>Subjectivism: \"What makes something right is how I feel about it.\"</p>\n<p>You must resist being charmed by the work of art, and not give in to your own emotional response to it, because it is possible to be wrong in these matters.</p>\n<p>In a culture saturated with technologies for appropriating our attention, our interior mental lives are laid bare as a resource to be harvested by others.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Matthew B.
