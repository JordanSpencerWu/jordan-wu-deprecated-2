The problem with innovation, too often, you meet with success in the short term, only to find yourself falling back into your old ways when your initial burst of enthusiasm fades away.</p>\n<p>The alternative strategy is called kaizen - \"A journey of a thousand miles must begin with the first step.\"</p>\n<p>Kaizen and innovation are the two major strategies people use to create change. Where innovation demands shocking and radical reform, all kaizen asks is that you take small, comfortable steps toward improvement.</p>\n<p>Low-key change helps the human mind circumnavigate the fear that blocks success and creativity.</p>\n<p>To meet life's constant demands for change by seeking out continual - but always small - improvement.</p>\n<p>While the steps may be small, what we're reaching for is not.</p>\n<p>When life gets scary and difficult, we tend to look for solutions in places where it is easy or at least familiar to do so, and not in the dark, uncomfortable places where real solutions might lie.</p>\n<p>Use time of difficulty to remember that fear is the body's gift, alerting us to a challenge.</p>\n<p>Fear tend to sort themselves into two major categories: the fear of not being worthy and the fear of losing control.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll build the kaizen habit of asking yourself small and positive questions.</p>\n<p>Mind sculpture, people imagine the movement of their muscles, and the rise and fall of their emotions.</p>\n<p>You can train your brain by small increments to develop the new set of skills it needs to actually engage in this task.</p>\n<p>All it takes is one small step to affect a dramatic improvement.</p>\n<p>Kaizen asks us to be patient. It asks us to have faith that with small steps, we can better overcome the mind's initial resistance to change.</p>\n<p>When we are trying to make a change, it can be tempting to ignore the subtle warning signs.</p>\n<p>When we face personal crises, the kaizen strategy of solving small problems offers consolation and practical assistance.</p>\n<p>When our lives are in great distress, even while we are feeling out of control or in emotional pain, we can try to locate the smaller problems within the larger disaster, and perhaps apply any or all of the kaizen techniques to move us slowly in the direction of a solution.</p>\n<p>Small rewards are not only sufficient as an incentive to get a job done, but they are optimal.</p>\n<p>The kaizen approach to life require a slower pace and an appreciation of small moments.</p>\n<p>Through kaizen, we can regain more of that precious quality of childhood: the ability to take pleasure in the moment, to become fascinated with those around us and whatever we are doing.</p>\n<p>The essence of kaizen: an optimistic belief in our potential for continuous improvement.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Robert Maurer"],"seo_description":"The kaizen way - one small step can change your life by Robert Maurer notes.","title":"The Kaizen Way - One Small Step Can Change Your Life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-kaizen-way/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
