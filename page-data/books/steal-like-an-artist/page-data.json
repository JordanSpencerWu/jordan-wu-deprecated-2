Every day.</p>\n<p>Fake it til you make it.</p>\n<p>you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.</p>\n<p>We learn by copying.</p>\n<p>Copying is about reverse-engineering.</p>\n<p>First, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy.</p>\n<p>Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them. Adding something to the world that only you can add.</p>\n<h3>WRITE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ</h3>\n<p>write what you like</p>\n<p>Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use - do the work you want to see done.</p>\n<h3>USE YOUR HANDS</h3>\n<p>We need to move, to feel like we-re making something with our bodies, not just our heads.</p>\n<p>You need to find a way to bring your body into your work.</p>\n<h3>SIDE PROJECTS AND HOBBIES ART IMPORTANT</h3>\n<p>Practice productive procrastination.</p>\n<p>Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing.</p>\n<p>Take time to mess around.</p>\n<h3>DO GOOD WORK AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE</h3>\n<p>you want attention only after you're doing really good work.</p>\n<p>When you're unknown, there's nothing to distract you from getting better.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.</p>\n<p>Do good work and share it with people.</p>\n<h3>GEOGRAPHY IS NO LONGER OUR MASTER</h3>\n<p>You don't have to live anywhere other than the place you are to start connecting with the world you want to be in.</p>\n<p>All you need is a little space and a little time - a place to work, and some time to do it.</p>\n<p>Where we choose to live still has a huge impact on the work we do.</p>\n<h3>BE NICE</h3>\n<p>\"There's only one rule I know of: You've got to be kind.\"</p>\n<p>\"The best way to get approval is to not need it.\"</p>\n<p>You can't go looking for validation from external sources.</p>\n<h3>BE BORING</h3>\n<p>It takes a lot of energy to be creative.</p>\n<p>Learn about money as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.</p>\n<p>Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Inertia is the death of creativity.</p>\n<p>Do the work every day, no matter what.</p>\n<p>Work gets done in the time available.</p>\n<p>Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time.</p>\n<p>\"marry well\". Who you marry is the most important decision you'll ever make.</p>\n<h3>CREATIVITY IS SUBTRACTION</h3>\n<p>In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what's really important to them.</p>\n<p>The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself.</p>\n<p>\"What we respond to in any work of art is the artist's struggle against his or her limitations.</p>\n<p>You must embrace your limitations and keep moving.</p>\n<p>Creativity isn't just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Austin Kleon"],"seo_description":"Steal like an artist - 10 things nobody told you about being creative by Austin Kleon notes.","title":"Steal Like an Artist - 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/steal-like-an-artist/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
