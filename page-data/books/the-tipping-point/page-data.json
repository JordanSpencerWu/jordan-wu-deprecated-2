The strength of weak ties.</p>\n<p><strong>Maven</strong> means one who accumulates knowledge and shares it with others, the motivation is to educate and help.</p>\n<p><strong>Salesmen</strong> are a group of people with the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are hearing. Emotion is contagious.</p>\n<p>The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them.</p>\n<h5>The Stickiness Factor</h5>\n<p>In epidemics, the massager matter: messengers are what make something spread. But the content of the message matter too. And the specific quality that a message needs to be successful is the quality of \"stickiness.\"</p>\n<p>If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhance stickiness.</p>\n<p>Watching something intellectually and physically, the more memorable and meaningful it becomes.</p>\n<p>There is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. All you have to do is find it.</p>\n<h5>The Power of Context</h5>\n<p>Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and places in which they occur.</p>\n<p>The impetus to engage in a certain kind of behavior is not coming from a certain kind of person but from feature of the environment.</p>\n<p>An epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, by tinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment.</p>\n<p>The essence of the Power of Context is that in ways that we don't necessarily appreciate, our inner states are the results of our outer circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honesty isn't a fundamental trait or a \"unified\" trait. A trait like honesty is considerably influenced by the situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Fundamental Attribution Error</strong> FAE: when it comes to interpreting other people's behavior, human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance of fundamental character traits and underestimating the importance of the situation and context.</p>\n<p>Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bounded together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context.</p>\n<p>The Power of Context says that those <em>Tipping Points</em> may be as simple and trivial as everyday signs of disorder.</p>\n<p>Power of Context says simply that children are powerfully shaped by their external environment, that the features of our immediate social and physical world, the streets we walk down, the people we encounter, plays a hug role in shaping who we are and how we act.</p>\n<p><strong>The Rule of 150</strong> suggests that the size of a group is another one of those subtle contextual factors that can make a big difference. The advantage of This Rule is to exploit the bonds of memory and peer pressure. When people know each other well, they create an implicit joint memory system, a transactive memory system, which is based on an understanding about who is best suited to remember what kinds of things. The psychological preconditions for transactive memory: it's knowing someone well enough to know what they know, and knowing them well enough so that you can trust them to know things in their speciality.</p>\n<h5>Conclusion</h5>\n<p>The paradox of the epidemic: that in order to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many small movements first.</p>\n<p>Translation: What Mavens and Connectors and Salesmen do to an idea in order to make it contagious is to alter it in such a way that extraneous details are dropped and others are exaggerated so that the message itself comes to acquire a deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>That our environment plays as big, if not bigger, a role as heredity in shaping personality and intelligence.</p>\n<p>That the environmental influence that helps children become who they are, that shapes their character and personality, is their peer group.</p>\n<p>That people can radically transform their behavior or beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. We are actually powerfully influenced by our surroundings, our immediate context, and the personalities of those around us.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Malcolm Gladwell"],"seo_description":"The tipping point - ow little things can make a big difference by Malcolm Gladwell notes.","title":"The Tipping Point - How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-tipping-point/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
