If I am wrong, I will learn from it, and my wisdom will have deepened. I'm willing to be wrong, and grow from it. I trust this process of acting from my deepest wisdom.\"</p>\n<p>Every man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to any particular relationship. If a man prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disserves the universe, and cheats his woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.</p>\n<p>Everything in your life, from your diet to your career, must be aligned with your purpose if you are to act with coherence and integrity in the world. If you know your purpose, your deepest desire, then the secret of success is to discipline your life so that you support your deepest purpose and minimize distractions and detours.</p>\n<p>You can give love to your family and engage your life's work, if you discipline yourself to act on your deepest desires with priority.</p>\n<p>A good woman will love the childlike part of you, but she wants your life to be guided by your deepest truths, not your untended childhood wounds.</p>\n<p>A superior man: a man who does his best to live as love in the world and in his intimacy, a man whose heart remains open and whose truth remains strong even when his woman criticizes him.</p>\n<p>Shiva, the divine masculine: unperturbable, totally loving, fully present, and all-pervading.</p>\n<p>A woman will always test her man for the pleasure of feeling his strength in loving, his capacity to transcend nuisance, his persistence in his own truth, and his capacity to share that truth in love with her, even when she is complaining - especially when she is complaining.</p>\n<p>When you listen to your woman, listen to her as you would the ocean, or the wind in the leaves. The sounds you hear from her are sounds of the motion of her feeling-energy.</p>\n<p>The \"truth\" of the feminine is whatever she is really feeling, in this present moment.</p>\n<p>Don't believe the literal content of what your woman says unless love is flowing deeply and fully in the moment when she says it.</p>\n<p>If you want your woman to grow in her radiance, health, happiness, love, beauty, power, and depth, praise these qualities.</p>\n<p>The whole point of an intimacy is to serve each other in growth and love, hopefully in better ways than we can serve ourselves.</p>\n<p>A superior man sees his woman's mood not as a curse, but as a challenge and an amusement.</p>\n<p>A happy woman is a woman relaxed in her body and heart: powerful, unpredictable, deep, potentially wild and destructive, or calm and serene, but always full of life, surrendered to and moved by the great force of her oceanic heart.</p>\n<p>Feminine priority is the flow of love in relationship and masculine priority is purpose and direction.</p>\n<p>Always help your woman make decisions by giving her your perspective and telling her your choices, while letting her know that you love her regardless of the decision she makes.</p>\n<p>Masculine men are attracted to forms of feminine energy: radiant women, beer, music, nature, etc. If a man tries to hide his attraction, it reveals some degree of shame with respect to his own sexual core.</p>\n<p>If you are a man with a masculine sexual essence, you will always feel sexual polarity with anyone who animates feminine energy.</p>\n<p>You are always attracted to your sexual reciprocal.</p>\n<p>The feminine body is free to be moved by love, and by life itself.</p>\n<p>This is what you get in a woman with a feminine sexual essence: A woman who is all over the place emotionally.</p>\n<p>You will only be happy in intimacy if you choose a woman who is your sexual reciprocal as a partner. And you will only be able to survive such an intimacy if her dark and light sides are equally embraceable to you.</p>\n<p>To serve one another's enlightenment through your unwavering commitment to love, and to enliven one another's core by the bodily transmission of love via sexual polarity.</p>\n<p>A superior man practices maintaining full consciousness in all situations.</p>\n<p>Underneath your woman's superficial request is her actual desire and need: she wants your passionate fullness to pervade her, she wants to be able to trust the unsinkability of your loving, she wants to feel in her bones that your divine masculine presence is stronger than your distractibility.</p>\n<p>Although your woman seems to want to be the most important thing in your life, she actually can trust and love you more if she is not.</p>\n<p>To live free in spirit, you must be willing to face your fears and let go of anything that limits your love.</p>\n<p>Your body, tone of voice, and the look in your eyes mean a lot more to her than anything you could say.</p>\n<p>She knows that if you are not free to meet her dark destructress energy and ravish her in love, you won't be free to meet the dark destructress of the world - who will challenge your spiritual freedom - with strength and love.</p>\n<p>Her gift, if she is a good woman, is to test you with her darkest moods, over and over and over, until your consciousness is unperturbed by feminine challenge, and you are able to pervade her with your love, just as you are here to pervade the world.</p>\n<p>A woman's true radiance reveals the degree to which she is open, trusting, connected, and loving.</p>\n<p>Your lust reveals your real desire to unite with the feminine, to penetrate as deeply as possible, to receive her delicious light as radiant food for your masculine soul, and to give her your entirety, losing yourself in the giving, so that you are both liberated beyond your selves in the explosion of your gifts.</p>\n<p>If you choose to engage the world and women fully, then you must maintain a certain degree of polarization or mutual attraction with them.</p>\n<p>Rather than deciding to move on because you are too weak to overcome your own neutralized lack of desire, try to take on the challenge of manifesting love in the dreary world and in your dreary woman.</p>\n<p>If ejaculation is not completely a matter of conscious choice for you, your woman knows she controls you sexually.</p>\n<p>The direction of growth of a relationship is primarily the man's responsibility. The energy of an intimacy - pleasure, sexual flow, and vitality - is primarily the woman's responsibility.</p>\n<p>Your main gift in intimacy is to guide her, moment by moment, out of her moods and into the openness of loving.</p>\n<p>Moment by moment, practice loving through your woman and the world, allowing the force of your surrender to transform every moment into an orgasm of divine dissolution. Embrace every moment of experience as a lover, and trust whatever direction love moves you. Die in the giving of your gift, so you don't even notice you have stopped holding onto yourself. Fear is your final excuse. Don't fight it. Love through it.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["David Deida"],"seo_description":"The way of the superior man - a spiritual guide to mastering the challenges of women, work, and sexual desire by David Deida notes.","title":"The Way Of The Superior Man - A Spiritual Guide To Mastering The Challenges Of Women, Work, And Sexual Desire"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-way-of-the-superior-man/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
