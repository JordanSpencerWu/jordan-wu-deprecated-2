Instead we'll create data structures and write pure functions that operate on those data structures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Higher-Order Function HOF means that a) you can treat a function as a value and b) you can pass that value into other functions.</p>\n<p>\"Functional code is characterized by one thing: the absence of side effects.\"</p>\n<p>In modern functional programming, lambda means \"anonymous function.\"</p>\n<p>Lambda calculus refers to \"a formal way to think about functions.\"</p>\n<p>\"Things that can be mapped over shall be called Functor.\"</p>\n<p>Combinator: \"a style of organizing libraries centered around the idea of combining things.\"</p>\n<p>A mantra for writing pure functions: Output depends only on input.</p>\n<p>Signs of impure functions.
