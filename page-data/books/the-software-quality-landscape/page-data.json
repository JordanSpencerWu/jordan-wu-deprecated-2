External characteristics of quality are the only kind of software characteristics that user care about. Programmers care about both external and internal quality characteristics.</p>\n<p>Software quality assurance is a planned and systematic program of activities designed to ensure that a system has the desired characteristics.

The best way to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging.</p>\n<h5>Lists of Characteristics of Software Quality 1-8 are external quaility while 9-15 are internal quality</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Correctness</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Usability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Reliability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Integrity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Adaptability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Robustness</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Portability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Reusability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Readability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Testability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Understandability</strong></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This book contains many useful tips about software construction and best practices on creating clean code.
