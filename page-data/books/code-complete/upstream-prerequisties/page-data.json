Before the construction process there are upstream activities such as architecture, design and project planning. These preparation activities goal is to reduce risk by focusing on improving requirements and project plans.</p>\n<h5>Problem Definition</h5>\n<p>The first prerequisite is the \"problem definition\", define what the problem is without any reference to possible solutions and should sound like a problem. This should be described from a user's point of view.</p>\n<h5>Requirements</h5>\n<p>Requirements describe in detail what a software system is supposed to do, and they are the first step toward a solution. Use explicit requirements where the user rather than the programmer drives the system's functionality, the user can review them and agree to them. Specifying requirements adequately is a key to project success!</p>\n<h5>Architecture</h5>\n<p>Software architecture is the high-level part of software design, the frame that holds the more detailed parts of the design. The quality of the architecture determines the conceptual integrity of the system, this in turns determines the ultimate quality of the system. Architecture changes are expensive to make, it takes the same time as a needed fix to a requirement error. The cost of architectural changes increases as more code is written for the wrong architecture, so be sure the architecture is right.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Measure Twice, Cut Once - Upstream Prerequiesities"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/upstream-prerequisties/"}}}
