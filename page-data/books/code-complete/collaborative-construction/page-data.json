This is based on the ideas that developers are blind to some of the trouble spots, and it's beneficial for developers to have someone else look at their work.</p>\n<p>Reviews are an important mechanism for giving programmers feedback about their code. Programmers who are still we behind the ears need guidance from those who are more knowledgeable.</p>\n<p>With collective ownership, all code is owned by the group rather than by individuals and can be accessed and modified by various members of the group.</p>\n<p>When pair programming, one programmer types in code at the keyboard and the other programmer watches for mistakes and think strategically about whether the code is being written correctly and whether the right code is being written.</p>\n<p>An inspection is a specific kind of review that has been shown to be extremely effective in detecting defects and to be relatively economical compared to testing.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Collaborative Construction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/collaborative-construction/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
