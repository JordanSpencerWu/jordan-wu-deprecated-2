Languages that require you to declare data explicitly are, in essence, requiring you to use data more carefully, which is one of their primary advantages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Improper data initialization is one of the most fertile sources of error in computer programming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scope, or visibility, refers to the extent to which your variables are known and can be referenced throughout a program. It's always a good idea to localize references to variables by keeping them close together. A variable's life begins at the first statement in which it's referenced; it's life ends at the last statement in which it's referenced. A short live time makes your code more readable, fewer lines of code a reader has to keep in mind at once.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Persistence\" is another word for the life span of a piece of data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Binding time\": the time at which the variable and its value are bound together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sequential data consists of clusters of data used together in a certain order. Selective data is a collection in which one of several pieces of data is used at any particular time. Iterative data is the same type of data repeated several times.
