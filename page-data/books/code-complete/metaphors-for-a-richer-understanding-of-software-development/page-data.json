Metaphors is a powerful technique that can be used in software development, here is an example from The Pragmatic Programmer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't Live with Broken Windows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In cities there are some buildings that are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulk. Research shows that the main trigger mechanism that turns a clean building into a smashed and abandoned derelict, is a broken window.</p>\n<p>One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandoned - a sense that the owner don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins.</p>\n<p>The simple solution to this problem is to fix the broken window as soon as possible so that <em>entropy</em> disorder doesn't spread.</p>\n<p>This applies to programming called software rot, create clean code so that your software doesn't rot. Bad code will decrease productivity and you won't meet the project deadlines.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/metaphors-for-a-richer-understanding-of-software-development/"}}}
