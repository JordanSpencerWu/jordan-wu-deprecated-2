When statements have dependencies that require you to put them in a certain order, take steps to make the dependencies clear.</p>\n<p>You might encounter cases in which one statement doesn't depend on, or logically follow, a statement. But ordering affects readability, performance, and maintainability. Use this guiding principle called Principle of Proximity: <em>keep related actions together</em>. They can be related because they operate on the same data, perform similar tasks, or depend on each other's being performed in order.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Design In Construction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/organizing-straight-line-code/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
