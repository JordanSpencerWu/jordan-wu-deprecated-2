If the decision doesn't change while the loop is executing, you can unswitch the loop by making the decision outside the loop.</p>\n<p>Jamming, or \"fusion\" is the result of combining two loops that operate no the same set of elements.</p>\n<p>If the loop is a search loop, one way to simplify the test is to use a sentinel value, a value that you put just past the end of the search range and that's guaranteed to terminate the search.</p>\n<p>The key to improving the loop is that the outer loop executes much more often than the inner loops, put the busiest loop on the inside.</p>\n<p>Reducing strength means replacing an expensive operation such as multiplication with a cheaper operation such as addition.</p>\n<p>Change in data types can be a powerful aid in reducing program size and improving execution speed.</p>\n<p>Used named constants and literals that are the same type as the variables they're assigned to.</p>\n<p>One of the most powerful tools in code tuning is a good routine decomposition. Small, well-defined routines saves space because they take the place of doing jobs separately in multiple places.</p>\n<p>Code tuning invariably involves tradeoffs among complexity, readability, simplicity, and maintainability on the one hand and a desire to improve performance on the other.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Code-Tuning Techniques"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/code-tuning-techniques/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
