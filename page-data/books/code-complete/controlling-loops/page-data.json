Flexibility and the location of the test determine the kind of loop to choose as a control structure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don't know ahead of time exactly how many times you'll want the loop to iterate, use a <em>while</em> loop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <em>for</em> loop is a good choice when you need a loop that executes a specific number of times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The advantage of <em>foreach</em> loop is eliminating loop-housekeeping arithmetic and therefore eliminating any chance of errors in the loop-housekeeping arithmetic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Efficient programmers do the work of mental simulations and hand calculations because they know that such measures help them find errors.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Controlling Loops"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/controlling-loops/"}}}
