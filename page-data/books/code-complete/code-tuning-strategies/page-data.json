Code tuning is one way of improving a program's performance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Users are more interested in tangible program characteristics than they are in code quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code tuning is the practice of modifying correct code in ways that make it run more efficiently. \"Tuning\" refers to small-scale changes that affect a single class, a single routine, or, more commonly, a few lines of code.</p>\n<p>Use a high-quality design. Make the program right. Make it modular and easily modifiable so that it's easy to work on later. When it's complete and correct, check the performance.</p>\n<p>When shopping for a compiler, compare the performance of each compiler on your program. Each compiler has different strengths and weaknesses, and some will be better suited to your program than others.</p>\n<p>You always have to profile the program to know with any confidence which parts are slow and fat.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"seo_description":"Code complete second edition - a practical handbook of software construction by Steve McConnell notes.","title":"Code-Tuning Strategies"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/code-complete/code-tuning-strategies/"}}}
