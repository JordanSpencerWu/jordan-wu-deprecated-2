Be a man of poise and authority.</p>\n<p>If you want to make better decisions in your interactions with women, master your own emotions so that you never find yourself afraid of hers.</p>\n<p>A woman wants a man who leads with compassion and who loves with passion.</p>\n<p>Relationships are meant to be a place of healing and growth.</p>\n<p>The ONLY way you can tell if a woman is comfortable and open to letting you lead her is the man whose authority she can submit to is by setting your own boundaries with her and refusing to engage her on her terms.</p>\n<p>A quality woman is more than willing to stand by her man through thick and thin so long as he's already proven himself as being worthy of her support.</p>\n<p>Focus your energy on becoming a strong, self-assured man at your core.</p>\n<p>Nice Guys, male doormats, and conflict-avoidant men are petrified of being \"misunderstood\" or disliked, especially by women.</p>\n<p>Framing, the awareness that the most sacred thing about a man is the integrity of his own mind. It's the notation that a man must have such a strong conviction of his core values that nothing in his external environment can shake him or his self-belief or remove him from his path.</p>\n<p>Develop rock-solid self-belief by becoming a better man.</p>\n<p>Remember, in order for a man to fully loving a woman he must overcome his fear of her emotions.</p>\n<p>Woman want to be loved by a man who leads. Any effort to seduce her or win her heart with romance will only backfire if she doesn't already respect you as a man.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Bruce Bryans"],"seo_description":"What women want when they test men - how to decode female behavior, pass a woman's tests, and attract women through authenticity by Bruce Bryans notes.","title":"What Women Want When They Test Men - How To Decode Female Behavior, Pass A Woman's Tests, And Attract Women Through Authenticity"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/what-women-want-when-they-test-men/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
