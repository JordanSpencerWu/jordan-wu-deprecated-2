Choose the Right Victim</h4>\n<p>Seduction is a process that occurs over time - the longer you take and the slower you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim.</p>\n<p>People's thoughts tend to revolve around their daily concerns and insecurities, you cannot proceed with a seduction until you slowly put their anxieties to sleep and fill their distracted minds with thoughts of you.</p>\n<p>Everything depends on the target of your seduction; the perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.</p>\n<p>Pay greater attention to those responses outside conscious control - a blush, an involuntary mirroring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of anger or resentment. All of these show that you are having an effect on a person who is open to your influence.</p>\n<p>The perfect victim is the person who stirs you in a way that cannot be explained in words.</p>\n<h4>2. Create a False Sense of Security - Approach Indirectly</h4>\n<p>Once you have chosen the right person, you must make the target come to you.</p>\n<p>There is nothing more effective in seduction than making the seduced think that they are the one doing the seducing.</p>\n<h4>3. Send Mixed Signal</h4>\n<p>Your attractiveness will pass unless you spark the more enduring kind of spell that makes people think of you in your absence.</p>\n<p>To capture and hold attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery.</p>\n<h4>4. Appear to be an Object of Desire - Create Triangles</h4>\n<p>Make people compete for your attention, make them see you as sought after by everyone else.</p>\n<p>Do not let your targets see you so often, keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach. An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.</p>\n<h4>5. Create a Need - Stir Anxiety and Discontent</h4>\n<p>The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness is the weakness on which all seducers prey.</p>\n<p>Your task as a seducer is to create a wound in your victim, aiming at their soft spot, the chink in their self-esteem.</p>\n<p>Groups or nations as well as individuals: they cannot be seduced without being made to feel some lack.</p>\n<h4>6. Master the Art of Insinuation.</h4>\n<p>To sow a seductive idea, you will need to engage people's imaginations, their fantasies, their deepest yearning.</p>\n<p>In seduction it is better not to talk about your love for a person. Let your target read it in your manners.</p>\n<p>Hints, suggestions, and insinuations create a seductive atmosphere, signaling that their victim is no longer involved in the routines of daily life but has entered another realm.</p>\n<h4>7. Enter Their Spirit</h4>\n<p>The way to lure people out of their natural intractability and self-obsession is to enter their spirit.</p>\n<p>The way to entice people out of this shell is to become more like them, in fact kind of mirror image of them.</p>\n<h4>8. Create Temptation</h4>\n<p>As a seducer, you can never mistake people's appearance for reality.</p>\n<p>The most potent temptations often involve psychological taboos and forbidden fruit.</p>\n<h4>9. Keep Them in Suspense - What Comes Next?</h4>\n<p>The source of an elemental human pleasure: being led by a person who knows where they are going, and who takes us on a journey.</p>\n<p>Falling in love involves anticipation; we are about to head off in a new direction, enter a new life, where everything will be strange.</p>\n<p>Anything that happens suddenly seems natural, and anything that seems natural has a seductive charm.</p>\n<h4>10. Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion</h4>\n<p>You cannot seduce without an ability to get outside your own skin and inside another person's, piercing their psychology.</p>\n<p>The key is to see words as a tool not for communicating true thoughts and feelings but for confusing, delighting, and intoxicating.</p>\n<p>You must say things that please - things that relate to people's lives, that touch their vanity.</p>\n<p>Stay vague and ambiguous, allowing the reader the space to imagine and fantasize.</p>\n<h4>11. Pay Attention to Detail</h4>\n<p>In seduction, you are always trying to bring the target back to the golden moments of childhood.</p>\n<p>A gift has immense seductive power, but the object itself is less important than the gesture, and the subtle thought or emotion that it communicates.</p>\n<p>Never tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures.</p>\n<h4>12. Poeticize Your Presence</h4>\n<p>We are often likely to fall for someone who resembles us in some way.</p>\n<p>People are dying to be given the chance to fantasize about you.</p>\n<p>Remember: if you are easily had, you cannot be worth that much.</p>\n<h4>13. Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability</h4>\n<p>What is natural to your character is inherently seductive.</p>\n<p>What works best is to allow people an occasional glimpse into the soft, frail side of your character, and usually only after they have known you for a while.</p>\n<p>The display of a single weakness will hide a multitude of manipulation.</p>\n<h4>14. Confuse Desire and Reality - The Perfect Illusion</h4>\n<p>What you aim for is \"uncanny\", something strange and familiar at the same time, like a deja vu, or a childhood memory - anything slightly irrational and dreamlike.</p>\n<p>The more you set things up like a play or a piece of fiction, the better.</p>\n<h4>15. Isolate the Victim</h4>\n<p>In seduction, as in warfare, the isolated target is weak and vulnerable.</p>\n<p>To seduce your targets, you need to lure them away, gently, slowly, from the affairs that fill their mind.</p>\n<h4>16. Prove Yourself</h4>\n<p>Many times, a seduction fails because the seducer does not correctly read the resistance of the target.</p>\n<p>Understand a primary law of seduction: resistance is a sign that the other person's emotions are engaged in the process.</p>\n<p>The heat of seduction is raised by such challenges - show me that you really love me.</p>\n<h4>17. Effect a Regression</h4>\n<p>Give people a sensation similar to that protected, dependent feeling of childhood and they will project all kinds of fantasies onto you, including feelings of love or sexual attraction that they will attribute to something else.</p>\n<h4>18. Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo</h4>\n<p>Give a person the sense that with you they will have a chance to explore the outer reaches of acceptable, polite behavior, that with you they can vent some of their closeted personality, and you create the ingredients for a deep and powerful seduction.</p>\n<p>For every deeply held value there is a shadow side, a doubt, a desire to explore what those values forbid.</p>\n<h4>19. Use Spiritual Lures</h4>\n<p>Remember that seduction is a mental process, and nothing more mentally intoxicating than religion, spirituality, and the occult.</p>\n<p>In a world where too much is controlled and manufactured, the sense that fate, necessity, or some higher power is guiding your relationship is doubly seductive.</p>\n<h4>20. Mix Pleasure with Pain</h4>\n<p>You have more to fear by boring your targets than by shaking them up.</p>\n<p>Wounding people binds them to you more deeply than kindness.</p>\n<p>Falling is love means literally falling - losing control, a mix of fear and excitement.</p>\n<p>As a seducer you must find a way to lower people's resistance.</p>\n<p>Your seduction should never follow a simple course upward toward pleasure and harmony.</p>\n<p>What makes us intensely appreciate something is previous suffering.</p>\n<p>Do not worry about making people angry; anger is a sure sign that you have your hooks in them.</p>\n<h4>21. Give Them Space to Fall - The Pursuer is Pursued</h4>\n<p>You don't want a passive little victim to toy with; you want the seduced to engage their will in all its force, to become active participants in the seduction.</p>\n<p>A person's willpower is directly linked to their libido, their erotic desire.</p>\n<p>We learn to love only through rejection.</p>\n<p>By experiencing a rejection or a coldness, we learn to court and pursue, to love.</p>\n<p>The only way to win you back, to have you for sure, will be to reverse the pattern, to imitate you, to be the affectionate, giving one.</p>\n<h4>22. Use Physical Lures</h4>\n<p>The only way to relax a distracted mind is to make it focus on one thing.</p>\n<p>As a seducer, you are a hypnotist, and what you are making the target focus on is you.</p>\n<p>The seducer leads the victim to a point where he or she reveals involuntary signs of physical excitation that can be read in various symptoms.</p>\n<p>Seduction, like warfare, is often a game of distance and closeness.</p>\n<h4>23. Master the Art of the Bold Move</h4>\n<p>In truth, timid people are often self-absorbed, obsessed with the way people see them, and not at all saintly.</p>\n<p>The pleasure of the one who surrenders is often greater than that of the aggressor.</p>\n<p>You are creating a moment that must stand out from the sameness of daily life.</p>\n<h4>24. Beware the Aftereffects</h4>\n<p>Seduction is a kind of spell, an enchantment.</p>\n<p>Familiarity is the death of seduction.</p>\n<p>Reality is not seductive.</p>\n<p>Once you have seduced a person there is almost always a lull, a slight letdown, which sometimes leads to a separation; it is surprisingly easy, though to re-seduce the same target.</p>\n<p>Revive the old images, the symbols, the expressions that will stir memory.</p>\n<p>Never see a separation or sacrifice as final. With a little drama and planning, a victim can be retaken in no time.</p>\n<h4>Playbook</h4>\n<p>Attraction comes before seduction.</p>\n<p>Attraction is not a choice.</p>\n<p>Leader of men. When you lead the men, the woman will follow.</p>\n<p>Convey lack of interest. As you demonstrate value and an utter lack of neediness, she will start to open up to you.</p>\n<p>She must become invested in this interaction, and then rapport must be established. Attraction is useful to bait her into investing.</p>\n<p>When she demonstrates value in an attempt to win you over, reward her with indicator of interest, then bait her again as the process repeats.</p>\n<p>They want a man who can keep it real. A girl needs to feel that she is getting to know the real you and that takes time.</p>\n<p>The security she feels from being with a strong man is a primary factor in her unconscious sexual selection strategy.</p>\n<p>A woman will almost always choose the man with higher value and a stronger frame. The only factor that counteracts this phenomenon is her level of investment in you.</p>\n<p>You are the prize, you are the one being chased, and you decide whether this will go to the next level and the next phase.</p>\n<p>The idea is to get her hoping that she's good enough to quality for you.</p>\n<p>Be natural and confident when touching, touching is one way that alpha males like you demonstrate their dominance.</p>\n<p>Comfort is not only trust and time; it is also compliance.</p>\n<p>The compliance threshold is the point of the interaction where she realizes that she has more fun if she complies.</p>\n<p>The game is played in comfort.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Robert Greene"],"seo_description":"The art of seduction by Robert Greene notes.","title":"The Art of Seduction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-art-of-seduction/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
