An integrated man is able to embrace everything that makes him unique: his power, his assertiveness, his courage, and his passion as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, and his dark side.</p>\n<p>Recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome is dependent on revealing one's self and receiving support from safe people.</p>\n<p>To children, abandonment means death and they are ego-centered.</p>\n<p>Toxic shame is the belief that one is inherently bad, defective, different, or unlovable.</p>\n<p>All Nice Guys internalized the same belief - it was a bad or dangerous thing for them to be just who they were.</p>\n<p>\"If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always had.\"</p>\n<p>By trying to please everyone, Nice Guys often end up pleasing no one - including themselves.</p>\n<p>Seeking women's approval gives women the power to define men and determine their worth.</p>\n<p>It is actually a person's rough edges and human imperfections that gives other something to connect with.</p>\n<p>Instead of seeking external validation and avoiding disapproval, recovering Nice Guys must begin seeking their own approval.</p>\n<p>Taking good care of the self is essential for changing one's belief about the self.</p>\n<p>Spending extended time alone is an important process in recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome. When alone, Nice Guys can discover who they are, what they like about themselves, and what rules they choose to govern their lives.</p>\n<p>Caretaking is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one's need met. Focusing on another's problems, needs, or feelings in order to feel valuable, get one's own needs met, or to avoid dealing with one's own problems or feelings.</p>\n<p>Since Nice Guys learned to sacrifice themselves in order to survive, recovery must center on learning to put themselves first and making their needs a priority.</p>\n<p>In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives.</p>\n<p>Personal power as a state of mind in which a person is confident he can handle whatever may come.</p>\n<p>The most important aspect of reclaiming personal power and getting what one wants in love and life is surrender. This means letting go of what one can't change and changing what one can.</p>\n<p>Surrender allows recovery Nice Guys to see each life experience as a \"gift\" from the universe to stimulate growth, healing, and learning.</p>\n<p>Even though Nice Guys often profess a deep desire to be intimately connected with another individual, their internalized toxic shame and childhood survival mechanisms make such connections difficult and problematic.</p>\n<p>Intimacy - \"knowing the self, being known by another, and knowing another.\"</p>\n<p>The enmeshing Nice Guy makes his partner his emotional center, he will do whatever it takes to make her happy.</p>\n<p>The avoiding Nice Guy seems to put his job, hobby, parents, and everything else before his primary relationship.</p>\n<p>Nice Guys will change the way they have relationships by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Approve of themselves</li>\n<li>Put themselves first</li>\n<li>Reveal themselves to safe people</li>\n<li>Eliminate covert contracts</li>\n<li>Take responsibility for their own needs</li>\n<li>Surrender</li>\n<li>Dwell in reality</li>\n<li>Express their feelings</li>\n<li>Develop integrity</li>\n<li>Set boundaries</li>\n<li>Embrace their masculinity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have one obviously wounded person in a relationship, you always have two.

Every time you settle, you get exactly what you settled for.</li>\n<li>Put yourself first.</li>\n<li>No matter what happens, you can handle it.</li>\n<li>Whatever you do, do it one hundred percent.</li>\n<li>If you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got.</li>\n<li>You are the only person on this planet responsible for your needs, wants, and happiness.</li>\n<li>Ask for what you want.</li>\n<li>If what you are doing isn't working, try something different.</li>\n<li>Be clear and direct.</li>\n<li>Learn to say \"no.\"</li>\n<li>Don't make excuses.</li>\n<li>If you are an adult, you are old enough to make your own rules.</li>\n<li>Let people help you.</li>\n<li>Be honest with yourself.</li>\n<li>Do not let anyone treat you badly, No one.

Victims never succeed.</li>\n<li>Live with integrity. Decide what feels right to you, then do it.</li>\n<li>Accept the consequences of your actions.</li>\n<li>Be good to yourself.</li>\n<li>Think \"abundance.\"</li>\n<li>Face difficult situations and conflict head on.</li>\n<li>Don't do anything in secret.</li>\n<li>Do it now.</li>\n<li>Be willing to let go of what you have so you can get what you want.</li>\n<li>Have fun, if you are not having fun, something is wrong.</li>\n<li>Give yourself room to fail.
