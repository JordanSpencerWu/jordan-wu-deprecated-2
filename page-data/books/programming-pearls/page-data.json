Even if these conditions aren't satisfied when there are multiple elements or extra data, for instance, a key from a finite domain can be used as an index into a table with more complicated entries.</p>\n<p>Multiple-Pass Algorithms: algorithms make several passes over their input data, accomplishing a little more each time.</p>\n<p>Less data to process means less time to process it, that reducing a program's space requirements also reduces its run time.</p>\n<p>Signature: When an equivalence relation defines classes, it is helpful to define a signature and no other item does.</p>\n<p>A proper view of data does indeed structure programs.</p>\n<p>Don't write a big program when a little one will do.</p>\n<p>Data structure can reduce big programs to small programs.</p>\n<p>Writing correct programs involves: problem definition, algorithm design, and data structure selection.</p>\n<p>Loop invariant: This assertion about the program state an invariant because it is true at the beginning and end of each iteration of the loop.</p>\n<p>Program verification: Programmers have a deeper understanding of programs, if they execute the program by hand on one input.</p>\n<p>Wise programmers instead build scaffolding to give them easy access to the function.</p>\n<p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.</p>\n<p>Divide-and-conquer: To solve a problem of size n, recursively solve two subproblems of size approximately n/2, and combine their solutions to yield a solution to the complete problem.</p>\n<p>Reducing space often has desirable side-effects on run time: smaller programs are faster to load and fit more easily into a cache, and less data to manipulate usually means less time to manipulate it.</p>\n<p>Simplicity can yield functionality, robustness, speed, and space.</p>\n<p>\"Code tuning\" locates the expensive parts of an existing program and then makes little changes to improve its speed.</p>\n<p>Premature optimization is the root of much programming evil.</p>\n<p>\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"</p>\n<h4>RULES FOR CODE TUNING</h4>\n<h5>Space-For-Time Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Data Structure Augmentation</strong>. The time required for common operation on data can often be reduced by augmenting the structure with extra information or by changing the information within the structure so that it can be accessed more easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Store Precomputed Results</strong>. The cost of recomputing an expensive function can be reduced by computing the function only once and storing the results. Subsequent requests for the function are then handled by table lookup rather than by computing the function.</p>\n<p><strong>Caching</strong>. Data that is accessed most often should be the cheapest to access.</p>\n<p><strong>Lazy Evaluation</strong>. The strategy of never evaluating an item until it is needed avoids evaluations of unnecessary items.</p>\n<h5>Time-For-Space Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Packing</strong>. Dense storage representations can decrease storage costs by increasing the time required to store and retrieve data.</p>\n<p><strong>Interpreters</strong>. The space required to represent a program can often be decreased by the use of interpreters in which common sequences of operations are represented compactly.</p>\n<h5>Loop Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Code Motion Out of Loops</strong>. Instead of performing a certain computation in each iteration of a loop, it is better to perform it only once, outside the loop.</p>\n<p><strong>Combining Tests</strong>. An efficient inner loop should contain as few tests as possible, and preferably only one. The programmer should therefore try to simulate some of the exit conditions of the loop by other exit conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Loop Unrolling</strong>. Unrolling a loop can remove the cost of modifying loop indices, and also help to avoid pipeline stalls, to reduce branches, and to increase instruction-level parallelism.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer-Driven Loop Unrolling</strong>. If a large cost of an inner loop is devoted to trivial assignments, then those assignments can often be removed by repeating the code and changing the use of variables. Specifically, to remove the assignment i = j, the subsequent code must treat j as though it were i.</p>\n<p><strong>Unconditional Branch Removal</strong>. A fast loop should contain no unconditional branches. An unconditional branch at the end of a loop can be removed by \"rotating\" the loop to have a conditional branch at the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>Loop Fusion</strong>. If two nearby loops operate on the same set of elements, then combine their operational parts and use only one set of loop control operations.</p>\n<h5>Logic Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Exploit Algebraic Identities</strong>. If the evaluation of a logical expression is costly, replace it by an algebraically equivalent expression that is cheaper to evaluate.</p>\n<p><strong>Short-Circuiting Monotone Functions</strong>. If we wish to test whether some monotone nondecreasing function of several variables is over a certain threshold, then we need not evaluate any of the variables once the threshold has been reached.</p>\n<p><strong>Reordering Tests</strong>. Logical tests should be arranged such that inexpensive and often successful tests precede expensive and rarely successful tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Precompute Logical Functions</strong>. A logical function over a small finite domain can be replaced by a lookup in a table that represents the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Boolean Variable Elimination</strong>. We can remove Boolean variables from a program by replacing the assignment to a Boolean variable v by an if - else statement in which one branch represents the case that v is true and the other represents the case that v is false.</p>\n<h5>Procedure Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Collapsing Function Hierarchies</strong>. The run times of the elements of a set of functions that nonrecursively call themselves can often be reduced by rewriting functions in line and binding the passed variables.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploit Common Cases</strong>. Functions should be organized to handle all cases correctly and common cases efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Coroutines</strong>. A multiple-pass algorithm can often be turned into a single-pass algorithm by use of coroutines.</p>\n<p><strong>Transformations on Recursive Functions</strong>. The run time of recursive functions can often be reduced by rewriting recursion to iteration.</p>\n<p><strong>Parallelism</strong>. A program should be structured to exploit as much of the parallelism as possible in the underlying hardware.</p>\n<h5>Expression Rules</h5>\n<p><strong>Compile-Time Initialization</strong>. As many variables as possible should be initialized before program execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploit Algebraic Identities</strong>. If the evaluation of an expression is costly, replace it by an algebraically equivalent expression that is cheaper to evaluate.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Subexpression Elimination</strong>. If the same expression is evaluated twice with none of its variables altered between evaluations, then the second evaluation can be avoided by storing the result of the first and using that in place of the second.</p>\n<p><strong>Pairing Computation</strong>. If two similar expressions are frequently evaluated together, then we should make a new procedure that evaluates them as a pair.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploit Word Parallelism</strong>. Use the full data-path width of the underlying computer architecture to evaluate expensive expressions.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Jon Bentley"],"seo_description":"Programming pearls second edition by Jon Bentley notes.","title":"Programming Pearls Second Edition"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/programming-pearls/"}}}
