The tools well have become extensions of your hands.</p>\n<h5>Pragmatic Paranoia</h5>\n<p>Perfect software doesn't exist, use this to your advantage by applying techniques that test for the correctness of your code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can't write perfect software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>Bend, or Break</h5>\n<p>The world is constantly changing, so does your code, focus on producing flexible and adaptable software.</p>\n<h5>While You Are Coding</h5>\n<p>Developers who don't actively think about their code or programming by coincidence - the code might work, but there's no particular reason why.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avoid programming by coincidence - relying on luck and accidental successes - in favoring of programming deliberately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>Before the Project</h5>\n<p>Requirement gathering rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Work with a user to think like a user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>Pragmatic Projects</h5>\n<p>The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Golden Rule \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Terms</h4>\n<p><strong>Entropy</strong> is a term from physics that refers to the amount of \"disorder\" in a system. When disorder increases in software, programmers call it \"software rot\".</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Repeat Yourself DRY</strong>, every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthogonality</strong>, two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Cohesion</strong>, components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Reversibility</strong> means producing flexible and adaptable software.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracer code</strong> is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has.</p>\n<p><strong>Prototyping</strong> generates disposable code.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracing statements</strong> are used to watch the state of a program or a data structure over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Rubber Ducking</strong> a useful technique for finding the cause of a problem is simply to explain it to someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Code Generators</strong> are code that writes code, task of producing the same code over and over again.</p>\n<p><strong>Design by Contract DBC</strong> a powerful technique that focuses on documenting and agreeing to the rights and responsibilities of software modules to ensure program correctness.</p>\n<p><strong>Lazy code</strong>: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupling</strong>, the dependencies among modules of code.</p>\n<p><strong>Shy code</strong>: don't reveal yourself to others, and don't interact with too many people.</p>\n<p><strong>Decoupling</strong>, reducing the dependencies among modules of code.</p>\n<p><strong>Law of Demeter for functions</strong> attempts to minimize coupling between modules in any given program.</p>\n<p><strong>Metadata</strong> is any data that describes the application - how it should run, what resources it should use, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporal coupling</strong> is about time dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrency</strong> are things happening at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Model-View-Controller MVC</strong>: separating the model from both the GUI that represents it and the controls that manage the view.</p>\n<p><strong>Big O Notation</strong>: estimating the resources that algorithms use - time, processor, memory, and so on.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access Array => <strong>O1</strong></li>\n<li>Simple loops => <strong>On</strong></li>\n<li>Nested loops => <strong>Om x n</strong></li>\n<li>Binary chop => <strong>Olgn</strong></li>\n<li>Divide and Conquer => <strong>n lgn</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Premature optimization</strong>: a good idea to make sure an algorithm really is a bottleneck before investing your precious time trying to improve it.</p>\n<p><strong>Refactoring</strong>: rewriting, reworking, and re-architecting code.</p>\n<p><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: testing done on each module, in isolation, to verify its behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing against contract</strong> tells us two things: whether the code meets the contract, and whether the contracts means what we think it means.</p>\n<p><strong>Documenting Requirements</strong>, you want to write likely scenarios that describe what the application need to do and publish a document that everyone can use as a basis for discussions - the developers, the end users, and the project sponsors.</p>\n<p><strong>Use cases</strong>: describe a particular use of the system - not in terms of user interface, but in a more abstract fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> are not architecture. Requirements are not designs, nor are they the user interface. Requirements are need.</p>\n<p><strong>Project glossary</strong> - one place that defines all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project.</p>\n<p><strong>Project specification</strong> is the process of taking a requirement and reducing it down to the point where a programmer's skill can take over.</p>\n<p><strong>Seamless approach</strong>: specification and implementation are simply different aspects of the same process - an attempt to capture and codify a requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality officer</strong> - someone to whom the team delegates the responsibility for the quality of the deliverable.</p>\n<p><strong>Chief water tester</strong>: this person check constantly for increased scope, decreased time scales, additional features, new environments - anything that wasn't in the original agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Project librarian</strong>: responsible for coordinating documentation and code repositories.</p>\n<p><strong>Tool Builders</strong>: to construct and deploy the tools that automate the project drudgery.</p>\n<p>A <strong>build</strong> is a procedure that takes on empty directory and builds the project from scratch, producing whatever you hope to produce as a final deliverable.</p>\n<p><strong>Final builds</strong>: which you intend to ship as products, may have different requirement from the regular nightly build.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration testing</strong> shows that the major subsystem that make up the project work and play well with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-world conditions</strong>, in the real world, your programs don't have limitless resources; they run out of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Regression test</strong> compares the output of the current test with previous or known values.</p>\n<p><strong>Test data</strong>: there are only two kinds of data: real-world data and synthetic data.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage analysis</strong> tools watch your code during testing and keep track of which lines of code have been executed and which haven't.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal documentation</strong> includes source code comments, design and test document, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>External documentation</strong> is anything shipped or published to the outside world, such as user manuals.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Andrew Hunt","David Thomas"],"seo_description":"The pragmatic programmer - from journeyman to master by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas notes.","title":"The Pragmatic Programmer - From Journeyman To Master"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-pragmatic-programmer/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
