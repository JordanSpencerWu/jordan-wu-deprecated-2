First, there is a <strong>cue</strong>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit is use. Then there is the <strong>routine</strong>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <strong>reward</strong>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time this loop becomes more and more automatic and a habit is born.</p>\n<p>Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced.</p>\n<p>When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.</p>\n<p>Habits are so powerful, they create neurological craving.</p>\n<p>This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.</p>\n<p>Golden Rule of habit change, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit.</p>\n<p>Belief is the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. We do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible.</p>\n<p>If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group.</p>\n<p>Keystone habits say that success doesn't depend on getting single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. Small wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes. \"Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.\" The second way that keystone encourage habits change: by creating structures that help other habits to flourish. The final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.</p>\n<p>The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.</p>\n<p>Willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. Willpower is a learnable skill.</p>\n<p>This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.</p>\n<p>\"People want to be in control of their lives.\"</p>\n<p>Organizational habit offer a basic promise: If you follow the established patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won't destroy the company, the profits will roll in, and, eventually, everyone will get rich.</p>\n<p>Habits are unique to each person.</p>\n<p>People's buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event.</p>\n<p>If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it.</p>\n<p>Our weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential, if not more, than our close-tie friends.</p>\n<p>For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling.</p>\n<p>Habit reigned supreme, the behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves.</p>\n<p>We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function. However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. We know bad habits exist and once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom and responsibility to remake them.</p>\n<p>The will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change and that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once we choose who we want to be, people grow to the way in which they have been exercised, just as sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>if you believe you can change, if you make it a habit, the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be.</p>\n<p>The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are these two-young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says 'Morning boys. How's the water?' And the two-young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes 'What the hell is water?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surrounds us every day and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.</p>\n<p>Every habit abides by a set of rules, and when you understand those codes you gain influence over them. Any habit can be changed.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Charles Duhugg"],"seo_description":"Habit - why we do what we do in by Charles Duhugg notes.","title":"Habit - Why We Do What We Do In Life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-power-of-habit/"}}}
