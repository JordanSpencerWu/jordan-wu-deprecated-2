Boosting or cutting is exactly like moving a volume fader up or down for a given frequency band. However with an EQ the volume fader is static.</p>\n<p>In a multiband compressor that same volume fader can automatically move up and down in response to the loudness of the incoming signal.</p>\n<p>Dynamic EQing = Multiband Compression</p>\n<p>An EQ is a static adjustment to the shape of the sound.</p>\n<p>In order for a multiband compressor to act dynamically, the signal going into it must also be dynamic.</p>\n<h5>Frequency Band</h5>\n<p>A multiband compressor allows you to independently select and treat frequency ranges with compression.</p>\n<h5>Blend/Contrast Theory</h5>\n<p>All you need to do is decide if an instrument is blending or contrasting.</p>\n<p>Make sure there's 1 instrument that's louder <strong>contrasting</strong>, and the rest are just supporting <strong>blending</strong>.</p>\n<p>Blend/contrast is a universal art.</p>\n<p>Front = Contrast</p>\n<p>Back = Blend</p>\n<h5>2 main results Multiband Compression can achieve:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Transient Control - means shaping the peak volume</li>\n<li>Transient Enhancement will always = More Contrast</li>\n<li>Transient Reduction will always = More Blend</li>\n<li>Volume Leveling - reducing the difference between loud and quiet portions so it stays in place and not moving front or back</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Multiband compressing at the individual track or group level is actaully what gives you the most control over your entire mix, and it leads to the best mixes.</p>\n<p>Remember the rule to do cutting based EQ decision before compressing.</p>\n<h4>Techniques</h4>\n<h5>Transient Enhancement of Plucky Sounds</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a Frequency Band from 1khz - 20khz on the desired instrument</li>\n<li>Set Attack 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Release 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio 2:1</li>\n<li>Set Makeup Gain +6db</li>\n<li>Bring Threshold down until you get 4 - 6db of reduction</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Transient Reduction of Plucky Sounds</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a Frequency Band from 1khz - 20khz on the desired instrument</li>\n<li>Set Attack 0ms</li>\n<li>Set Release 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio 2:1</li>\n<li>Bring Threshold down until the transient disappears just a little more than nescessary</li>\n<li>Set attack 2 - 10ms to get back some transient information</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Controlling Sweeping Resonant Peaks</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Play an instrument with a sweeping and very resonant filter. You'll see the resonant peak sweeping across the frequency spectrum on the spectrum analyzer. As it sweeps notice where it begins to stick out in your mix. Wherever it starts and wherever it ends will be the boundaries of your compression band. Usually 800hz - 7khz.</li>\n<li>Set Attack 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Release 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio 2:1</li>\n<li>Bring Threshold down until you get enough gain reduction to prevent the offending resonant frequency range from poking out in your mix</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Controlling Frequency Peaks at the Group/Bus Level</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Put the Multiband Compressor on the group</li>\n<li>Set just one Frequency Band at 800hz - 5khz</li>\n<li>Set Attack to 10ms</li>\n<li>Set Release to 20 - 30ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio to 2:1</li>\n<li>As the entire mix plays, bring the Threshold down until it catches the specific parts where the volume builds up in that frequency range and swamps your lead instrument</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Shaping Snare Body</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a Frequency Band 100hz - 300hz, or just so the frequency band is center on the snare bump you see on a spectrum analyzer.</li>\n<li>Set the Attack to 30ms</li>\n<li>Set the Release to 30ms</li>\n<li>Set the Ratio to 2:1</li>\n<li>Add Makeup Gain until you get the fullness and body you want</li>\n<li>Now bring the Threshold down until you like the body shape you've got</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Shaping Snare Snap</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a Frequency Band to between 5khz - 20khz</li>\n<li>Set Attack to 15ms</li>\n<li>Set Release to 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio 4:1</li>\n<li>Add 2 - 4db of makeup gain, just like you're EQ boosting the high frequency content of the sound.</li>\n<li>Bring the Threshold down until you get 2 - 4db of compression</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Adding Kick Punch</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a Frequency Band 80hz - 120hz</li>\n<li>Set Attack 20ms</li>\n<li>Set Release 30ms</li>\n<li>Set Ratio 2:1 or 4:1 depending on the desired aggressiveness of the effect</li>\n<li>Add 1 - 6db Makeup Gain depending on how much punch you'd like to have</li>\n<li>Bring the Threshold down until you get the sound you want or you've got 1 - 6db of gain reduction</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Removing Kick Woofiness</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Set Frequency Band somewhere between 150hz - 800hz</li>\n<li>You can find the problem frequencies faster by bringing the makeup gain of that band down -6db and then sliding the band left to right until you get the biggest improvement.
