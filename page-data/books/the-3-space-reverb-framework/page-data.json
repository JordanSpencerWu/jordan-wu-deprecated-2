Low diffusion create a more lively, and echoey drum room. High diffusion creates a smoother drum room.\nMod Rate/Depth: Mod depth is somewhere between 5 - 20%\nEQ: A drum room's low frequencies should disappear before its high frequencies</p>\n<h4>The Middle Space Reverb</h4>\n<p>Predelay: 10 - 20ms\nDecay: 1 - 2sec\nHicut: 8k - 15k\nDiffusion: Set to taste\nMod Rate/Depth: Between 5 - 30%\nEQ: Should complement your long-decay reverb's EQ in such a way that they give each other space.</p>\n<h4>The Back Space Reverb</h4>\n<p>Predelay: 1 - 15ms\nDecay: 2 - 8sec\nHicut: 5k - 12k\nDiffusion: Usually always at max\nMod Rate/Depth: Between 15 - 50%\nEQ: Has the most natural bass decay</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Nathan Nyquist"],"seo_description":"The 3-space reverb framework by Nathan Nyquist notes.","title":"THE 3-SPACE REVERB FRAMEWORK"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-3-space-reverb-framework/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
