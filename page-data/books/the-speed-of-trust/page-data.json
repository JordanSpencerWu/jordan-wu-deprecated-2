The more we do it, the more confidence we have that we can do it, that we will do it. The more we trust ourselves.</p>\n<p>Credibility is something we can do something about.</p>\n<h4>4 Cores of Credibility:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrity</li>\n<li>Intent</li>\n<li>Capabilities</li>\n<li>Results</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The Roddick Choice\" - demonstrating integrity even when it is costly.</p>\n<h4>Integrity</h4>\n<p>Congruence is a person who has integrity when there is no gap between intent and behavior... when he or she is whole, seamless, the same - inside and out.</p>\n<p>Humility is a humble person who is more concerned about what is right than about being right, about acting on good ideas than having the ideas, about embracing new truth than defending outdated position, about building the team than exalting self, about recognizing contribution than being recognized for making it.</p>\n<p>Integrity also includes the courage to do the right thing - even when it's hard.</p>\n<h4>How to increase Integrity:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Make and keep commitments to yourself</li>\n<li>Stand for something</li>\n<li>Be open</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Intent</h4>\n<p>Intent matters and it grows out of character.</p>\n<p>While we tend to judge ourselves by our intent, we tend to judge others by their behavior.</p>\n<p>Our perception of intent has a huge impact on trust.</p>\n<p>It is important for us to actively influence the conclusion others draw by \"declaring our intent\".</p>\n<p>Intent is defined as \"plan\" or \"purpose\".</p>\n<p>Motive is your reason for doing something.</p>\n<p>The motive that inspires the greatest trust is genuine caring.</p>\n<p>Agenda is what you intend to do or promote because of your motive.</p>\n<p>The agenda that generally inspires the greatest trust is seeking mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Behavior is the manifestation of motive and agenda.</p>\n<p>The behavior that best create credibility and inspires trust is acting in the best interest of others.</p>\n<p>\"Trustee standard\": acting in the best interest of others.</p>\n<p>People judge us and we judge them based on observable behavior.</p>\n<p>Be careful to not interpret the intent of others by projecting your own intent onto their behavior and also to realize that often others may be interpreting your intent in this way.</p>\n<h4>How to improve your intent:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Examine and refine your motives</li>\n<li>Declare your intent</li>\n<li>Choose abundance</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Capabilities</h4>\n<p>Capabilities - the talents, skills, knowledge, capacities, and abilities we have that enables us to perform with excellence.</p>\n<p>We need to constantly improve our capabilities.</p>\n<p>\"Technical abilities\" - those skills that are specific to our job or situation or particular task at hand.</p>\n<p>\"Trust abilities\" - the ability to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust.</p>\n<h4>How to increase your capabilities:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Run with your strengths and with your purpose</li>\n<li>Keep yourself relevant</li>\n<li>Know where you're going</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Results</h4>\n<p>Results matter to your credibility.</p>\n<p>Being good at your job and being good at fitting into the culture.</p>\n<p>Our credibility comes not only from our past results and our present results, but also from the degree of confidence others have in our ability to produce results in the future.</p>\n<h4>How to improve your results:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Take responsibility for results</li>\n<li>Expect to win</li>\n<li>Finish strong</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>THE SECOND WAVE - RELATIONSHIP TRUST: The Principle of Behavior</h4>\n<p>Relationship trust is all about consistent behavior.</p>\n<p>The truth is that in every relationship personal and professional - what you do has far greater impact than anything you say.</p>\n<p>People can and do change behavior.</p>\n<p>\"Paradigm shifts\" - changes in way you see or think about things that create significant changes in behavior.</p>\n<p>\"Behavior shifts\" - shifts in doing that actually change the way you see and think.</p>\n<p>You can behave yourself into the kind of person you want to be.</p>\n<h4>Trust accounts:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Each trust account is unique</li>\n<li>All deposits and withdrawals are not created equal</li>\n<li>What constitutes a \"deposit\" to one person may not to another</li>\n<li>Withdrawals are typically larger than deposits</li>\n<li>Sometimes the fastest way to build trust is to stop making withdrawals</li>\n<li>Recognize that each relationship has two trust accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that every interaction with every person is a \"moment of trust\". The way you behave in that moment will either build or diminish trust.</p>\n<p>By behaving in ways that build trust with one, you build trust with many.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #1: TALK STRAIGHT</h4>\n<p>TELL THE TRUTH AND LEAVE THE RIGHT IMPRESSION</p>\n<p>Leaving the right impression means communicating so clearly that you cannot be misunderstood.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #2: DEMONSTRATE RESPECT</h4>\n<p>First, to behave in ways that show fundamental respect for people and second, to behave in ways that demonstrate caring and concern.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #3: CREATE TRANSPARENCY</h4>\n<p>The only way to build trust professionally and personally is by being trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Create transparency - is about being open.</p>\n<p>It's about being real and genuine and telling the truth in a way people can verify.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #4: RIGHT WRONGS</h4>\n<p>It's doing what you can to correct the mistake... and then a little more.</p>\n<p>Make things right when you're wrong.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #5: SHOW LOYALTY</h4>\n<p>Show loyalty is giving credit to others, and speaking about people as though they were present.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #6: DELIVER RESULTS</h4>\n<p>Results give you instant credibility and instant trust.</p>\n<p>Producing results almost always gives a person more choices, more options, more flexibility.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #7: GET BETTER</h4>\n<p>When people see you as a learning, growing, renewing person or your organization as a learning, growing, renewing organization - they develop confidence in your ability to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, enabling you to build high trust relationships and move with incredible speed.</p>\n<p>\"It's not what you know, it's how fast you can learn.\"</p>\n<p>Seek feedback and learn from mistakes.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #8: CONFRONT REALITY</h4>\n<p>Confront reality is about taking the tough issues head-on.</p>\n<p>Don't afraid to deliver bad news.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #9: CLARIFY EXPECTATIONS</h4>\n<p>Clarify expectations is to create shared vision and agreement about what is to be done up front.</p>\n<p>\"Clarity is power.\"</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #10: PRACTICE ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>\n<p>First hold yourself accountable and second hold others accountable.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #11: LISTEN FIRST</h4>\n<p>To listen first means not only to really listen, but to do it first.</p>\n<p>\"Leadership ultimately means understanding people.\"</p>\n<p>\"Listen with your eyes for feeling.\"</p>\n<p>Listen for as well as to listen to.</p>\n<p>Listen to yourself, to your gut feeling, your own inner voice, before you decide, before you act.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #12: KEEP COMMITMENTS</h4>\n<p>When you make a commitment, you build hope; when you keep it, you build trust.</p>\n<p>Making and keeping commitments to yourself is the key to success in making and keeping commitments to others.</p>\n<h4>BEHAVIOR #13: EXTEND TRUST</h4>\n<p>People tend to not trust people who don't trust them.</p>\n<p>Extend trust abundantly to those who have earned your trust.</p>\n<p>Extend trust conditionally to those who are earning your trust.</p>\n<h3>THE THIRD WAVE - ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST: The Principle of Alignment</h3>\n<p>It's about designing and aligning systems that promote trust.</p>\n<p>\"Trust is the most significant predictor of individuals' satisfaction within their organizations.\"</p>\n<p>A symbol of trust is a symbol that inspired loyalty and creativity.</p>\n<h3>THE FOURTH WAVE - MARKET TRUST: The Principle of Reputation</h3>\n<p>Market trust is all about brand and reputation.</p>\n<p>\"Trust is a key building block in the creation of a company's reputation, and as a direct result, its shareholder value.\"</p>\n<p>Whatever trust we are able to create in our organizations and in the marketplace is a result of the credibility we first create in ourselves.</p>\n<h3>THE FIFTH WAVE - SOCIETAL TRUST: The Principle of Contribution</h3>\n<p>Trust is an integral part of the fabric of our society.</p>\n<p>Societal trust is contribution and the intent to create value instead of destroy, to give back instead of take.</p>\n<p>\"Universal mission statement\": To increase the economic well-being and quality of life of all stakeholders.</p>\n<h3>Inspiring trust</h3>\n<p>Your ability to appropriately extend trust to others is the single most impactful factor in creating a high-trust environment, both at work and at home.</p>\n<p>The first job of a leader is to inspire trust.</p>\n<p>\"Propensity to trust\" is primarily a matter of the heart, to believe that people are worthy of trust and a desire to extend it to them freely.</p>\n<p>\"Analysis\" is primarily a matter of the mind, the ability to come up with logical decisions and solutions.</p>\n<p>\"Smart trust\" is to combine the propensity to trust with the analysis to manage risk wisely.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Stephen M.R.
