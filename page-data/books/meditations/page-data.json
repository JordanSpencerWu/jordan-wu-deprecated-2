But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul.</p>\n<p>All things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.</p>\n<p>Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for cleaning away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.</p>\n<p>Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.</p>\n<p>Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seem to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.</p>\n<p>the offences which are committed through desire are more blamable than those which are committed through anger.</p>\n<p>regulate every act and thought accordingly.</p>\n<p>remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.</p>\n<p>For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived.</p>\n<p>WE OUGHT to consider that our life is daily wasting away and a smaller part of it is left.</p>\n<p>if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure.</p>\n<p>Make for thyself a definition or description of the things which is presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirely, and tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved.</p>\n<p>Let not act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.</p>\n<p>from thee are all things, in thee are all thing, to thee all things return.</p>\n<p>thy life is short. Thou must turn to profit and the present by the aid of reason and justice.</p>\n<p>If he is a stranger to the universe who does not know what is in it, no less is he a stranger who does not know what is going on in it.</p>\n<p>Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.</p>\n<p>Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them.</p>\n<p>Examine men's ruling principles.</p>\n<p>Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all thing which exist.</p>\n<p>In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations.</p>\n<p>I now have what the universal nature will me to have; and I do what my nature now wills me to do.</p>\n<p>If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change.</p>\n<p>other things trouble me not; for they are either things without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled and know not the way.</p>\n<p>We are all working together to one end, some with knowledge and design, and others without knowing what they do.</p>\n<p>A custom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and as much as it is possible, be in the speaker's mind.</p>\n<p>Let the wrong which is done by a man stay there where the wrong was done.</p>\n<p>that no men can escape his destiny, the next inquiry being how he may best live the time that he has to live.</p>\n<p>Love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread of thy destiny.</p>\n<p>Thou must blame nobody.</p>\n<p>For nothing should be done without a purpose.</p>\n<p>Everything exists for some end.</p>\n<p>I do it with reference to the good of mankind.</p>\n<p>remember that neither the future nor the past pains thee, but only the present.</p>\n<p>He who does not know what world is, does not know where he is.</p>\n<p>Loss is nothing else than change.</p>\n<p>If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and how him his error.</p>\n<p>These are the properties of the rational soul; it sees itself, analyses itself, and makes itself such as it chooses.</p>\n<p>for every man is allowed to seek his own good.</p>\n<p>No man can rob us of our free will</p>\n<p>I have often wondered how it is that every man love himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.</p>\n<p>So much more respect have we to what our neighbors shall think of us than to what we shall think of ourselves.</p>\n<p>See what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter, form, and purpose.</p>\n<p>If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.</p>\n<p>every man lives the present time only, and loses only this.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Marcus Aurelius"],"seo_description":"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius notes.","title":"Meditations"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/meditations/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
