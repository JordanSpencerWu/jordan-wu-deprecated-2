Arrogance, self-centered ambition. The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility, that's ego. If ego is the voice that tells us we're better than we really are we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.</p>\n<h5>ASPIRE</h5>\n<p>At any given time in life, people find themselves at one of three stages. We're aspiring to something, trying to make a dent in the universe. We have achieved success, perhaps a little, perhaps a lot. Or we have failed, recently or continually. We're aspiring until we succeed, we succeed until we fail or until we aspire to more, and after we fail we can begin to aspire or succeed again. Remember to be <strong>Humble</strong> in our aspirations, <strong>Gracious</strong> in our success, and <strong>Resilient</strong> in our failures.</p>\n<p>When we remove ego, we're left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility and confidence, Humility and reality are the cure to ego.</p>\n<p>Among men who rise to frame and leadership two types are recognizable, those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative, one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.</p>\n<h3>TALK, TALK, TALK</h3>\n<p>Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong. They work quietly in the corner. They turn their inner turmoil into products and eventually to stillness. They ignore the impulse to seek recognition before they act. They don't talk much. Or mind the feeling that others, out there in public and enjoying the limelight, are somehow getting the better end of the deal. They are not. They're too busy working to do anything else. When they do talk, it's <em>earned</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those who know do not speak.</p>\n<p>Those who speak do not know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>TO BE OR TO DO?</h3>\n<p>To be or to do? Whatever we seek to do in life, reality soon intrudes on our youthful idealism. This reality comes in many names and forms: incentives, commitments, recognition, and politics. In every case, they can quickly redirect us from <em>doing</em> to <em>being</em>. From <em>earning</em> to <em>pretending</em>. If we are not careful, we can very easily find ourselves corrupted by the very occupation we wish to serve. It's about the doing, not the recognition. What is it that I want to accomplish in life?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road and you’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go. He raised his hand and pointed. “If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd raised his other hand and pointed in another direction. “Or you can go that way and you can do something - something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life, there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>BECOME A STUDENT</h3>\n<p>To become great, one needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against plus, minus, and equal. To become great and stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on now, and what comes next. They must be always learning. We must all become our own teachers, tutors, and critics. A student is self-critical and self-motivated always trying to improve. The act of being an eternal student kept these men and women humble.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student. That's what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>DON'T BE PASSIONATE</h3>\n<p>Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Passion is seen in those who can tell you in great detail who they intend to become and what their success will be like, they might even be able to tell you specifically when they intend to achieve it or describe to you legitimate and sincere worries they have about the burdens of such accomplishments. They can tell you all the things they're going to do, or have even begun, but they cannot show you their progress. Because there rarely is any.</p>\n<p>Passion is <em>about</em>. I am so passionate about _<strong><em>. What human require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose is \\</em>to_ and <em>for</em>. I must do __</strong>. I was put here to accomplish _<strong>_. I am willing to endure __</strong> for the sake of this. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself. More than purpose, we also need realism. How are we sure that what we're doing is moving us forward?</p>\n<h3>FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY</h3>\n<p><em>Anteambulo</em> - \"one who clears the path\". Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss. It's not about kissing ass. It's about providing the support so that others can <em>be</em> good. Find a canvas for other people to paint on. Be an <em>anteambulo</em>. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you're the least important person in the room, until you change that with results. The canvas strategy is about, helping yourself by helping others. The person who clears that path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.</p>\n<h3>RESTRAIN YOURSELF</h3>\n<p>Our own path, whatever we aspire to, will in some ways be defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with. Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure. It doesn't matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how much money you have. When you want to do something, something big and important and meaningful, you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Those who have subdued their ego understands that it doesn't degrade <em>you</em> when others treat you poorly; it degrades them. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one.</p>\n<h3>GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD</h3>\n<p>Real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality. It is natural for any young, ambitious person or simply someone whose ambition is young to get excited and swept up by their thoughts and feeling. Especially in a world that tells us to keep and promote a \"personal brand.\" We're required to tell stories in order to sell our work and our talents, and after enough time, forget where the line is that separates our fictions from reality. Ultimately this disability will paralyze us. Or it will become a wall between us and the information we need to do our jobs. Living clearly and presently takes courage. Don't live in the haze of the abstract, live with the tangible and real, even if it's uncomfortable.</p>\n<h3>THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE</h3>\n<p>Christians believe that pride is a sin because it is a lie, it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man. You need only to care about your career to understand that pride, even in real accomplishments, is a distraction and a deluder. Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. Pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one. Let's call that attitude what it is: fraud. If you're doing the work and putting in the time, you won't need to cheat, you won't need to overcompensate. What we don't protect ourselves against are people and things that make us feel good, or rather, too good. We must prepare for pride and kill it early, or it will kill what we aspire to. Privately thinking you're better than others is still pride. It's still dangerous!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A proud man is always looking down on things and people; of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>WORK, WORK, WORK</h3>\n<p>To be both a craftsman and an artist. To cultivate a product of labor and industry instead of just a product of the mind. It's here where the abstraction meets the road and the real, where we trade thinking and talking for working. Sure, you get it. You know that all things require work and that work might be quite difficult. But do you really understand? Not work until you get your big break, not work until you make a name for yourself, but work, work, work, forever and ever. There is no end zone. We're simply talking about a lot of hours, that to get where we want to go isn't about brilliance, but continual effort. You can lie to yourself, saying that you put in the time, or pretend that you're working, but eventually someone will show up. You'll be tested. And quite possibly found out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I am going to be myself, the best version of that self. I am in this for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be.\" To <em>do</em>, not <em>be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>SUCCESS</h2>\n<p>Sometimes ego is suppressed on the ascent. Sometimes an idea is so powerful or timing is so perfect or one is born into wealth and power that it can temporarily support or even compensate for a massive ego. The worst disease which can afflict business executives in their work is not as popularly supposed, alcoholism; it's egotism. Whether in middle management or top management, unbridled personal egotism blinds a man to the realities around him; more and more he comes to live in a world of his own imagination; and because he sincerely believes he can do no wrong, he becomes a menace to the men and women who have to work under his direction. Without the right values, success is brief. If we wish to do more than flash, if we wish to last, then it is time to understand how to battle this new form of ego and what values and principles are required in order to beat it.</p>\n<h3>ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT</h3>\n<p>As we first succeed, we will find ourselves in new situations, facing new problems. It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. With accomplishment comes a growing pressure to pretend that we know more than we do. To pretend we already know everything. That's the worry and the risk, thinking that we're set and secure, when in reality understanding and mastery is a fluid continual process. No matter what you've done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you're not still learning, you're already dying. Learn from <em>everyone</em> and <em>everything</em>. An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning and even, occasionally, being shown up to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.</p>\n<h3>DON'T TELL YOURSELF A STORY</h3>\n<p>Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It's also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. It turns our life into a story and turns us into caricatures, while we still have to live it. There is real danger in believing it when people use the work \"genius\" and it's even more dangerous when we let hubris tell ourselves we are one. The same goes for any label that comes along with a career: are we suddenly a \"film-maker,\" \"writer,\" \"investor,\" \"entrepreneur,\" or \"executive\" because we've accomplished one thing? These labels put you at odds not just with reality, but with the real strategy that made you successful in the first place. From that place, we might think that success in the future is just the natural next part of the story, when really, it's rooted in work, creativity, persistence, and luck. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution and on executing with excellence.</p>\n<h3>WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU?</h3>\n<p>We're never happy with what we have, we want what others have too. We want to have <em>more</em> than everyone else. We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we've achieved it, we lost sight of our priorities. Ego sways us, and can ruin us. All of us waste precious life doing things we don't like, to prove ourselves to people we don't respect, and to get things we don't want. Ego undermines greatness by deluding its holder. Each one of us has a unique potential and purpose: that means that we're the only ones who can evaluate and set the terms of our lives. Far too often, we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet, and a result, squander our very potential and purpose.</p>\n<p>It's not about beating the other guy, it’s not about having more than the others. It's about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It's about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you're capable of in what you choose. That's it. No more and no less.</p>\n<h3>ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA</h3>\n<p>With success, particularly power, come some of the greatest and most dangerous delusions: entitlement, control, and paranoia. The problem lies in the path that got us to success in the first place. What we've accomplished often required feats of raw power and force of will. Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of the people around us. Persistence and courage in the face of ridiculous odds are partially irrational traits. A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their power and reach. Ego is its own worst enemy, it hurts the ones we love and our families and friends suffer for it.</p>\n<h3>MANAGING YOUSELF</h3>\n<p>As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. What matters is that you learn how to manage yourself and others, before your industry eats you alive. Responsibility requires a readjustment and increased clarity and purpose.</p>\n<h3>BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME</h3>\n<p>When they start, before they have won, a team is innocent. \"Innocent Climb\" happens when the conditions are right, they come together, they watch out for each other and work together toward their collective goal. After a team starts to win and media attention begins, players calculate their own importance. The Innocent Climb is almost always followed by the \"Disease of Me.\" For us, it's beginnings to think that we're better, that we're special, that our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else's that no one could possibly understand. Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition. We never earn the right to be greedy or to pursue our interests at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<h3>MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY</h3>\n<p>Ego tells us that meaning comes from activity, that being the center of attention is the only way to matter. Walk onto ancient battlefield or a place of historical significance. Look at the statues and you can't help but see how similar the people look, how little has changed since then, since before, and how it will be forever after. It's the sense that others have been here before you, generations of them, in fact. In those moments, we have a sense of the immensity of the world, we are a piece of this great universe and a process. Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When I look up in the universe, I know I'm small, but I'm also big. I'm big because I'm connected to the universe and the universe is connected to me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>MAINTAIN YOUR SOBRIETY</h3>\n<p>Sobriety is the command of oneself. We have to fight to stay sober, despite the many different forces swirling around our ego. Ego clouds the mind precisely when it needs to be clear. Sobriety is a counterbalance, a hangover cure. An elimination of the unnecessary and the destructive. No more obsessing about your image; treating people beneath you or above you with contempt; needing first-class trappings and lording over, condescending, and marveling at your own awesomeness or self-anointed importance. Sobriety is the counter weight that must balance out success.</p>\n<h3>FOR WHAT OFTEN COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY...</h3>\n<p>You must manage yourself in order to maintain your success. We can use the golden mean to navigate our ego and our desire to achieve. What's difficult is to apply the right amount of pressure, at the right time, in the right way, for the right period of time, in the right car, going in the right direction. Behind every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled, but when egotism take hold, we lost track of our goal and end up somewhere we never intended. We know what decisions we must make to avoid that ignominious, even pathetic end: protecting our sobriety, eschewing greed and paranoia, staying humble, retaining our sense of purpose, connecting to the larger world around us.</p>\n<p>Instead of letting power make us delusional and instead of taking what we have for granted, we'd be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life.</p>\n<h2>FAILURE</h2>\n<p>Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called failure. In order to taste success again, we've got to understand what led to this moment or these years of difficulty, what went wrong and why. We must deal with the situation in order to move pass it. The way through, the way to rise again, requires a reorientation and increased self-awareness. Ego loves the idea that something fair or not. We don't need pity, our own or anyone else's, we need purpose, poise, and patience. The great failing is \"to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth.\"</p>\n<h3>ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME</h3>\n<p>There are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, present this choice: Alive time. Dead time. As they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? Cast down your bucket where you are. Make use of what's around you. Don't let stubbornness make a bad situation worse.</p>\n<h3>THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH</h3>\n<p>In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly, yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. This reality rings essentially true for everyone in every kind of life. We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort. It's far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When the effort, not the results, good or bad, is enough.</p>\n<p>Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do our best to becoming the best that you are capable of becoming.</p>\n<h3>FIGHT CLUB MOMENTS</h3>\n<p>There are many ways to hit bottom. Almost everyone does in their own way, at some point. We surround ourselves with bullshit. With distractions, with lies about what makes us happy and what's important. We become people we shouldn't become and engage in destructive, awful behaviors. We'd call that hell, and on occasion we all spend some time there. How much better it would be to spare ourselves these experiences, but sometimes it's the only way the blind can be made to see.</p>\n<p>It was in those moments, when the break exposes something unseen before, that you were forced to make eye contact with a thing called Truth. No longer could you hide and pretend. The world can show you the truth, but no one can force you to accept it. But change begins by hearing the criticism and the words of the people around you. In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls.</p>\n<h3>DRAW THE LINE</h3>\n<p>People make mistakes all the time. We take risks. We mess up. The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It's a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. Let's say you've failed and let's even say it was your fault. Are you going to make it worse? Or are you going to emerge from this with your dignity and character intact? Only ego thinks embarrassment or failure are more than what they are. When we lose, we have a choice: Are we going to make this a lose-lose situation for ourselves and everyone involved? Or will it be a lose... and then win?</p>\n<p>At any given time in the circle of life, we may be aspiring, succeeding or failing. With wisdom, we understand that these positions are transitory, not statement about your value as a human being. When success begin to slip from your fingers, for whatever reason, the response isn't to grip and claw so hard that you shatter it to pieces. It's to understand that you must work yourself back to the aspirational phase.</p>\n<h3>MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD</h3>\n<p>The scoreboard was not the judge of whether he or the team had achieved success, that wasn't what constituted \"winning.\" A characteristic of how great people think. It's not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don't much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else's. Your potential, the absolute best you're capable of, that's the metric to measure yourself against.</p>\n<h3>ALWAYS LOVE</h3>\n<p>We all have stuff that pisses us off. The more successful or powerful we are, the more there will be that we think we need to protect in terms of our legacy, image, and influence. If we're not careful, however, we can end up wasting an incredible amount of time trying to keep the world from displeasing or disrespecting us. You know what is a better response to an attack or a slight or something you don't like? Love. You could at the very least try to let it go. You could try to shake your head and laugh about it.</p>\n<p>In failure or adversity, it's so easy to hate. Hate defers blame. It makes someone else responsible. It's a distraction too. Does this get us any closer to where we want to be? No. It just keeps us where we are or worse, arrests our development entirely. Meanwhile, love is right there. Egoless, open, positive, vulnerable, peaceful, and productive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We must strip ourselves of the ego that protects and suffocates us, because hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence. It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and objective center of your life.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY...</h3>\n<p>All great men and women went through difficulties to get to where they are, all of them made mistakes. They found within those experiences some benefit, even if it was simply the realization that they were not infallible and that things would not always go their way. They found that self-awareness was the way out and through, if they hadn't they wouldn't have gotten better and they wouldn't have been able to rise again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not to aspire or seek out of ego.</p>\n<p>To have success without ego.</p>\n<p>To push through failure with strength, not ego.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"author":["Ryan Holiday"],"seo_description":"Ego Is The Enemy by Ryan Holiday notes.","title":"Ego Is The Enemy"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/ego-is-the-enemy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
