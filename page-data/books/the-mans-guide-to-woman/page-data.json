Turn. Toward. Your. Partner.</li>\n<li><strong>UNDERSTAND</strong>: No matter what she is saying, the goal is understanding. And how you get to understanding is by asking questions.</li>\n<li><strong>NON-DEFENSIVELY LISTEN</strong>: Don't react. Her feelings are real to her at that moment.</li>\n<li><strong>EMPATHIZE</strong>: Try to feel how a woman is feeling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Being genuinely interested in her is much more important than trying to be interesting to her.</p>\n<p>If you want a relationship with a woman to last, she needs to know who you are, and she needs to feel safe with you.</p>\n<p>For women, being sexual is equivalent to being vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Men want less fighting and more sex.</p>\n<p>Emotions are not a problem for girls. They are a good thing, an opportunity for intimacy.</p>\n<p>For a woman there are no negative emotions.</p>\n<p>Emotions are opportunities for intimacy.</p>\n<p>The holy trinity for female hormones - estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone determines a woman's day to day reality; what she values; how outgoing or active she is; what her needs are; and what, when, and even who she desires.</p>\n<p>Her moods generally have nothing to do with you.</p>\n<p>Women experience fear in a very different way than men.</p>\n<p>When a woman is afraid, hold her hand and try to help her avoid feeling afraid.</p>\n<p>Women are attracted to men who are the CEO and president of themselves.</p>\n<p>The woman who ultimately controls whether or not a man approaches her.</p>\n<p>Your nonverbal cues that let a woman know you are high status, a protector, a provider.</p>\n<p>If she wants you, she will put a bid in your direction. The most common bid is direct eye contact. A smile. Repeatedly glancing at you and away from you. These are the signals; what you do with them is up to you.</p>\n<p>Mutual attraction is the only attraction worth having.</p>\n<p>The goal of dating is to find someone genuinely interested in you for who you really are.</p>\n<p>The way you create safety in a conversation is by being a good listener and being genuinely interested.</p>\n<p>Conversation is an art, and it's an art that puts the other person at center stage.</p>\n<p>Lower pitched voices in men are considered more attractive to women.</p>\n<p>Ask for her phone number or ask her out on a date.</p>\n<p>Dating is about putting her front and center.</p>\n<p>Dating is also about containing the conversation and getting to know each other.</p>\n<p>Pheromones are going to make a woman feel an attraction to you.</p>\n<p>A woman's sense of smell is stronger than a man's.</p>\n<p>Your smell matters.</p>\n<p>A woman always, always remembers the first kiss.</p>\n<p>People don't change.
