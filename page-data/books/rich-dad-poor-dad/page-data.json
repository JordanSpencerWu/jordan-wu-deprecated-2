The rich have money work for them.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #1: The Rich Don't Work For Money</h2>\n<p>Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed.</p>\n<p>Be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.</p>\n<p>Be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.</p>\n<p>avoid the trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire.</p>\n<p>money is an illusion</p>\n<p>We learned to make money work for us.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #2: Why teach financial literacy?</h2>\n<p>Intelligence solves problems and produces money.</p>\n<p>It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep.</p>\n<p>If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.</p>\n<p>Rich people acquire assets.</p>\n<p>Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.</p>\n<p>An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket.</p>\n<p>If you want to be rich, you've got to read and understand numbers.</p>\n<p>Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.</p>\n<p>An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.</p>\n<p>Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from my asset column compared with the expense column.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #3: Mind Your Own Business</h2>\n<p>The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.</p>\n<p>Most people work for everyone but themselves. They work first for the owners of the company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortage.</p>\n<p>The secret is: Mind your own business</p>\n<p>To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income column.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #4: The History Of Taxes And The Power Of Corporations</h2>\n<p>A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul.</p>\n<p>If you work for money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.</p>\n<p>financial knowledge is made up of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Accounting</li>\n<li>Investing</li>\n<li>Understanding market</li>\n<li>The law</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Lesson #5: The Rich Invest Money</h2>\n<p>The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.</p>\n<p>invest in your financial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #6: Work To Learn - Don't Work For Money</h2>\n<p>The main management skills needed for success are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Management of cash flow</li>\n<li>Management of systems</li>\n<li>Management of people</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing.</p>\n<p>Give, and you shall receive.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2>\n<p>The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.</p>\n<p>Winning means being unafraid to lose.</p>\n<p>Texans don't bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take their failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans to become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. It is the formula for all winners.</p>\n<p>I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity.</p>\n<p>The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing.</p>\n<p>Winning means being unafraid to lose.</p>\n<p>A savvy investor knows that the seemingly worst of times is actually the best of times to make money.</p>\n<p>What I know makes me money. What I don't know loses me money.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit</li>\n<li>Make daily choices: the power of choice</li>\n<li>Choose friends carefully: the power of association</li>\n<li>Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly</li>\n<li>Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline</li>\n<li>Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice</li>\n<li>Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing</li>\n<li>Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus</li>\n<li>Choose heros: the power of myth</li>\n<li>Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"author":["Robert Kiyosaki"],"seo_description":"Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki notes.","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/rich-dad-poor-dad/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
