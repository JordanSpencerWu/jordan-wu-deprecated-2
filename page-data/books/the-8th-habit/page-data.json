we are a product of choice, because there is always a space between stimulus and response.</p>\n<p>Leaders aren’t made or born; they are self-made - leadership is a function of choices.</p>\n<p>Three leadership attributes: vision, discipline, and passion.</p>\n<p>All things are created twice: first, a mental creation; second, a physical creation.</p>\n<p>Help others find their own voice.</p>\n<p>The key to creating passion in your life is to find your unique talents and your special role and purpose in the world.</p>\n<p>\"Know yourself, control yourself, give yourself.\"</p>\n<p>The more you use and magnify the gifts or talents you have been given, the more gifts and talents you are given.</p>\n<p>Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.</p>\n<p>Seeing, doing, and becoming.</p>\n<p>An organization is made up of individuals who have a relationship and a shared purpose.</p>\n<h4>Four Primary Management Practices:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Strategy - Devise and maintain a clearly stated, focused strategy</li>\n<li>Execution - Develop and maintain flawless operation execution</li>\n<li>Culture - Develop and maintain a performance-oriented culture</li>\n<li>Structure - Build and maintain a fast, flexible, flat organization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Inspiring Others to Find Their Voice involves FOCUS and EXECUTION.</p>\n<p>The key to influence is always to first be influenced, that is to first be open and seek understanding.</p>\n<p>90 percent of all leadership failures are character failures.</p>\n<p>Trust is the fruit of the trustworthiness of both people and organizations.</p>\n<p>Who we are is more important than who we appear to be?</p>\n<p>Trustworthiness comes from character and competence.</p>\n<p>Personal character: integrity, maturity and the Abundance Mentality.</p>\n<p>Make and keep promises.</p>\n<p>Relationship are maintained and deepened only as you actively nurture and build them with regular acts of kindness, consideration, appreciation and service.</p>\n<p>Strong relationships require real effort and sacrifice, they require putting someone else's well-being, growth and happiness before your own.</p>\n<p>Moral Authority: The principled exercise of free choice, which almost always involves some form of sacrifice.</p>\n<p>A trust deposit must mean something to the other person.</p>\n<p>Nothing destroys trust faster than making and breaking a promise and nothing build and strengthens trust more than keeping a promise you make.</p>\n<p>\"Lying makes a problem part of the future; truth makes a problem part of the past.\"</p>\n<p>Adults are big children.</p>\n<p>\"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is; treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.\"</p>\n<p>Trust is not only the fruit of trustworthiness; it is also the root of motivation.</p>\n<p>Love as a verb is something you do: the sacrifices you make and the giving of self.</p>\n<p>Think Win-Win is the idea or principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Empathic listening is to get deeply into the frame of reference of another person.</p>\n<p>We do not see the world as it is; we see the world as we are.</p>\n<p>To understand does not mean to agree with.</p>\n<p>Influence begins with modeling trustworthiness so that people will have confidence in you.</p>\n<p>Three primary roles of a leader - pathfinding, aligning, and empowering.</p>\n<p>Always seek the higher Third Alternative.</p>\n<p>Pathfinding is the first creation.</p>\n<p>Alignment - designing and executing systems and structures that reinforce the core values and highest strategic priorities of the organization.</p>\n<p>Alignment is institutionalized trustworthiness - the very principles that people have built into their value system are the basis for designing structures, systems, and processes.</p>\n<p>Form follows function. Structure follows purpose. Alignment follows pathfinding.</p>\n<p>ask \"What do you think?\"</p>\n<p>Successful organizations are system and culture dependent.</p>\n<p>Success lies in the system.</p>\n<p>The key to the principle of alignment is to always begin with the results.</p>\n<p>MODELING PRINCIPLE-CENTERED trustworthy behavior inspires trust without \"talking it.\" Pathfinding creates order without demanding it. Aligning nourishes both vision and empowerment with proclaiming them.</p>\n<p>Empowering enthrones self-control, self-management, and self-organizing.</p>\n<p>Our greatest financial investment is the knowledge worker.</p>\n<p>Servant leadership is about the trust that is consciously given to another - an act that leads me to feel your belief that I can add value.</p>\n<p>Duty, love and meaning are the highest sources of human motivation.</p>\n<p>Focus and Execution</p>\n<h4>The 4 Disciplines of Execution:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on the Wildly Important</li>\n<li>Create a Compelling Scoreboard</li>\n<li>Translate Lofty Goals into Specific Actions</li>\n<li>Hold Each Other Accountable - All of the Time</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"author":["Stephen R.
