Think in terms of <strong>bandwidth</strong> and <strong>center frequency</strong>. </p>\n<p>In a <strong>band reject</strong> filter the term bandwidth refers to a zone of frequencies to be attenuated rather than passed unaltered.</p>\n<p>Majority of filter allow you to specify a center frequency plus a resonance factor for the filter.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Q factor</strong> is defined as $Q = center frequency / bandwidth$</p>\n<p>The Q factor presents bandwidth in relation to the center frequency. When holding Q steady, bandwidth varies as a function of the center frequency, and it is the ratio between the center frequency and the bandwidth that remains constant.</p>\n<p>When working with high Q values, it is also possible to encounter an effect called <strong>ringing</strong>, which is an oscillation produced by <strong>transients</strong> that remains active after the transients have passed.</p>\n<p>The <strong>order</strong> of the filter defines the curve with which frequencies are attenuated.</p>\n<p>In digital filters the frequency region near the cutoff frequency is called the <strong>transition zone</strong>, and it is marked by roll-off attenuation that can be more or less steep depending on the implementation.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Alessandro Cipriani","Maurizio Giri"],"seo_description":"Noise generators, filters, and subtractive synthesis notes.","title":"Chapter 3T - NOISE GENERATORS, FILTERS, AND SUBTRACTIVE SYNTHESIS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/chapter-3T/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
