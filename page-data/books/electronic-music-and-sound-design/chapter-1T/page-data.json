It is the only waveform that contains a single frequency; all other waveforms are composed of multiple frequencies, and because of this, can be decomposed into a series of sinusoids, each of which contains the energy of a single component frequency.</p>\n<p>The four classic waveforms are: <strong>sine wave</strong>, <strong>square wave</strong>, <strong>sawtooth wave</strong>, and <strong>triangle wave</strong>.</p>\n<p>Remember that positive amplitudes, greater than zero, correspond to compression of the molecules of the transmission medium, while negative amplitudes correspond to rarefaction.</p>\n<p><strong>bipolar waves</strong> have both positive and negative portions within their wave cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>unipolar waves</strong> lie completely above or below the value 0, are often used to modify a parameter of a sound.</p>\n<p>A sound cannot switch suddenly from silence to its maximum amplitude. A finite time, however brief, is needed, during which the sound in question can evolve to its new state.</p>\n<p>The evolution of the amplitude of a sound can be divided into four basic parts: <strong>Attack</strong>, <strong>Decay</strong>, <strong>Sustain</strong>, <strong>Release</strong>.</p>\n<p>The evolution of the amplitude of a sound is called the <strong>envelope</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The evolution of transients plays an essential role in the definition of timbre by the listener.</strong></p>\n<p>When fashioning an envelope on the computer, we must be careful to avoid large instantaneous changes in amplitude. Abrupt changes will result in audible clicks within the sound.</p>\n<p>A <strong>glissando</strong> is a sound that continuously varies its frequency over time.</p>\n<p><strong>exponential curve</strong>: $y = a^x$</p>\n<p><strong>logarithmic curve</strong>: $y = log_{a}x$</p>\n<p>It is important to note that we hear the \"size\" of all octave intervals as equal, but that the difference in Hz between two sounds separated by an octave will vary.</p>\n<p>The digital recording of sound is called <strong>sampling</strong>, and generates a series of numbers, each of which is a <strong>sample</strong>: a measurement of the amplitude of the analog signal at a given instant. The process of digitization, in order to work correctly, must be performed at regular intervals; the number of amplitude measurements that are made on a regular basis in one second is defined as the <strong>sampling rate</strong>.</p>\n<p>An audio file can be monaural mono, stereo or multichannel.</p>\n<p>A <strong>monaural</strong> audio file contains a single sequence of numbers that encode its digital waveform.</p>\n<p>A <strong>stereo</strong> file, on the other hand, contains two digital sequences that can be converted in parallel, one for the left channel, and right channel, each representing one speaker of a pair, or one headphone channel.</p>\n<p>A <strong>multichannel</strong> file contains a variable number of sequences that can be sent to the same number of speakers.</p>\n<p>The term <strong>panning</strong> refers to the placement of sound within the spatial environment created by two or more channels.</p>\n<p>The <strong>power</strong> of a signal is its total energy, measured at the source.</p>\n<p>The <strong>intensity</strong> of a signal which we have generically indicated as a parameter tied to amplitude to this point is the energy transmitted by a sound wave through a given surface area during a given unit of time.</p>\n<p><strong>LEFT CHANNEL</strong>: $Amplitude * \\sqrt{1 - X}$</p>\n<p><strong>RIGHT CHANNEL</strong>: $Amplitude * \\sqrt{X}$</p>\n<p>where center is $X=0.5$, right only is $X=1$, and left only is $X=0$ </p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Alessandro Cipriani","Maurizio Giri"],"seo_description":"Introduction to sound synthesis notes.","title":"Chapter 1T - THEORY INTRODUCTION TO SOUND SYNTHESIS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/chapter-1T/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
