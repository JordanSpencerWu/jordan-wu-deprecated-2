you should treat it with care and recognize when you're subconsciously trying to avoid it.</p>\n<p>The process of creating art is, fundamentally, a process of work.</p>\n<p>Important sounds are typically mixed louder than less important ones.</p>\n<p>Sounds can be made to seem closer to the listener by making them louder, \"brighter\" an increase in high frequency content in comparison to other sounds, and/or \"dryer an increase in the amount of original, unprocessed signal in comparison to the amount of reverb applied to that signal.</p>\n<p>We can think of our musical elements themselves as being divided into <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>middle ground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong>.</p>\n<p>We tend to hear things as being in the foreground if they're high, loud, fast, or subject to a rapid rate of change.</p>\n<p><strong>Anticipation</strong> - Drums fills are a common technique used to create a sense of transition from one section to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Hesitation</strong> - Drum fill that lasts longer than expected, extending over the formal boundary between the sections and ending after the rest of the musical material has already changed to the new section.</p>\n<p><strong>Transposition</strong> means shifting an entire pattern of notes up or down by a specific number of semitones.</p>\n<p><strong>Inversion</strong> is the process of flipping a collection of notes \"upside-down\" so that the lowest note becomes the first note and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Retrograde/Reverse</strong> means flipping a collection of notes backwards, so that the last note becomes the first note and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Shifting</strong> - A looped passage of material can be started at an arbitrary position within the passage.</p>\n<p><strong>Pitch Rotation</strong> is a process where the rhythm of a passage of notes is retained but the pitches from the passage are shifted to the right or left in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantization</strong> is typically used to correct timing errors in manually played MIDI materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Slicing</strong> is typically to separate rhythmic events such as drum hits from audio material such as drum beats or bass lines.</p>\n<p>The <strong>tresillo</strong>, or 3+3+2 pattern, is a widely used rhythmic pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi-hats</strong> keep time, kick drums emphasize the beats, snares/claps are placed on or around the backbeats beats 2 and 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Polyphony</strong> - multiple instruments can play at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Monophonic</strong> - no two instruments can play at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost notes</strong> are extremely quiet notes, normally played on the snare drum, that help to fill in the space between the prominent notes in the pattern.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>EQ</strong> to create space for the bass in the kick drum's track, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>EQ</strong> on every other track to remove low end, which makes room for both kick and bass while reducing overall signal level.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>sidechain compression</strong> to automatically reduce the gain of the bass when the kick is sounding.</p>\n<p>You can use the spectrum analyzer to find the frequencies that are louder than the average noise level, and then use <strong>EQ</strong> to either emphasize those frequency if they happen to be in tune) or attenuate them if they're out of tune with respect to the harmonic and melodic part.</p>\n<p><strong>Time-stretching</strong>: adjusting the pitch of a sample independently of its tempo vice versa.</p>\n<p>The term <strong>contour</strong> is used to refer to the shape of a melody over time - whether the note rise to higher pitches, fall to lower ones, remain at the same pitch, or some combination of these.</p>\n<p>We use <strong>contour</strong> to discuss whether a melody moves by adjacent notes known as <strong>conjunct motion</strong> or <strong>motion by step</strong> or by larger intervals known as <strong>disjunct motion</strong> or <strong>motion by leap</strong>.</p>\n<p>Good melodies have a strong sense of balance between both aspects of contour: rise vs. fall and conjunct motions vs disjunct motion.</p>\n<p>If a melody has moved by step for a while, a good choice might be to then proceed by leap in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Good melodies often have a single peak note.</p>\n<p>Assuming a 4/4 meter, the first and third beat are considered \"strong\" or \"on\" beats while the second and fourth are considered \"weak\" or \"off\" beats. The odd-numbered subdivisions are perceived as stronger than the even-numbered ones.</p>\n<p>The smallest recognizable fragment of a melody is called a motive, and melodies are often constructed from just one or two motives.</p>\n<p>The combination of two or more intricate, independent, simultaneous melodies in a composition is called <strong>counterpoint</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Contrary motion</strong>, as a general guideline, counterpoint works best when the voices mostly move in opposite directions; one voice moves up while the other moves down.</p>\n<p><strong>Hocket</strong> is a compositional technique in which the notes of a melodic line quickly alternate between two or more different instrument, such that not two instruments are playing at the same time.</p>\n<p>\"sound-color melody\" refers to the distribution of a melody or even a single pitch between multiple instruments.</p>\n<p><strong>Scansion</strong> is the study of a text's inherent rhythm and the marking of each syllable in the text as being either strongly or weakly stressed.</p>\n<p>Most music is considered to be in a particular key.</p>\n<p>The relationship between the separate voices when moving between chords is known as voice leading.</p>\n<p>A lot of house music chord progressions are a technique called <strong>parallel harmony</strong>, which refers to a method of moving from one chord to another in which each note move by the same number of semitones and in the same direction.</p>\n<p>The rate at which the chords change in a piece of music is called the <strong>hormonic rhythm</strong>.</p>\n<p>The surface rhythm is the rhythm of individual notes and other events.</p>\n<p>As a general but by no means universal rule, music with a faster surface rhythm tends to have a slower harmonic rhythm, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Automation</strong> is perhaps most commonly used to precisely sculpt a mix to ensure that levels will be perfectly balanced at all points of the song.</p>\n<p>The <strong>arrangement</strong> refers to the layout of the parts of your song along a timeline.</p>\n<p>Creating successful arrangements requires having a great internal sense of proportion, an understanding of how long each song section needs to be in relation to the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Verse</strong> or <strong>\"A\" Section</strong>: A song's verse is generally a recurring section - usually 16 or 32 bars in length - that serves as the main body of the song.</p>\n<p><strong>Chorus</strong> or <strong>\"B\" Section</strong>: It acts as a contrast to the material of the verse and usually contains the \"hook\" of the song - a melodic idea that is intended to stick in the listener's head.</p>\n<p>In music with lyrics, the chorus often contains the title of the song.</p>\n<p>A general rule, the first chorus in a song occurs after a verse although there are some songs that begin with a chorus.</p>\n<p>The bridge serves as a contrast to both the verse and chorus and typically occurs only once in a song.</p>\n<p><strong>Layering</strong>: the careful addition and subtraction of parts in order to change the density of the underlying texture.</p>\n<p><strong>Buildup</strong>: usually 16 or 32 bars in length, or some multiple of those - in which layers are added, increasing the music's textural density and perceived sense of energy.</p>\n<p>The <strong>breakdown</strong> is a section of lower energy, designed as a contrast to the buildup, and involves either a gradual or sudden reduction in density. Some common breakdown techniques include removing all of the drum elements or, conversely, removing everything except drums.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop</strong>: The drop is the climax and is generally the most texturally dense passage of music in the track.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique events</strong> - sounds, gestures, or variation that occur only once and are never repeated.</p>\n<p><strong>Single events</strong> are short samples or sounds that can be strategically placed throughout your arrangement to add a layer of unpredictability.</p>\n<p><strong>Single musical gesture</strong> are short phrases or one-time alterations to otherwise consistently repeating patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Single processing gesture</strong>, one-time changes to the effects processing on one more track.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Dennis DeSantis"],"seo_description":"Making music 74 creative strategies for electronic music producers by Dennis DeSantis notes.","title":"Making Music 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/making-music/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
