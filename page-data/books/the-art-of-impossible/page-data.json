So what do you choose to do with the remaining two-thirds?</p>\n<p>The only real way to discover if you are capable of pulling off the impossible - whatever that is for you - is by attempting to pull off the impossible.</p>\n<p>Motivation is what gets you into this game; learning is what helps you continue to play; creativity is how you steer; and flow is how you turbo-boost the results beyond all rational standards and reasonable expectations.\nmotivation is a subset of skills: drive, grit, and goals.</p>\n<p>Drive refers to powerful emotional motivators such as curiosity, passion, and purpose.</p>\n<p>When work becomes play, that's one way to know for sure: Now, you're playing the infinite game.</p>\n<p>Goals, about figuring out exactly where we're actually trying to go.</p>\n<p>Grit, persistence, determination, and fortitude - that ability to continue with the journey no matter the difficulty involved.</p>\n<p>Extrinsic drivers are rewards that are external to ourselves.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic drivers are rewards that are internal to ourselves.</p>\n<p>\"I'm doing what I love. If you're doing what you want to do all the time then you're happy.\"</p>\n<p>Curiosity is where it begins. Next comes meaning and purpose which require connecting our individual passion to a cause much greater than ourselves. Finally, once you have purpose, you need to layer on the two remaining intrinsic drivers: autonomy and mastery. The system demands autonomy, which is the freedom to pursue that purpose. Then the system requires mastery, which is the desire to continually improve the skills needed to pursue that purpose.</p>\n<p>purpose boosts motivation, productivity, resilience, and focus.</p>\n<p>Purpose shifts our attention off ourselves (internal focus) and puts it onto other people and the task at hand (external focus).</p>\n<p>Curiosity into passion; passion into purpose; and purpose into patient profit - that's the safest way to play this game.</p>\n<p>Autonomy is the desire for the freedom required to pursue your passion and purpose.</p>\n<p>Mastery pushes you to hone the skills you need to achieve your passion and purpose.</p>\n<p>autonomy is the desire to steer your own ship, mastery is the drive to steer that ship well.</p>\n<p>intrinsic motivation is much more effective than extrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>controlled motivation is pressured into doing something</p>\n<p>autonomous motivation you're doing what you're doing by choice.</p>\n<p>Mastery is the desire to get better at the things we do.</p>\n<p>\"Big goals work best when there's an alignment between an individual's values and the desired outcome of the goal. When everything lines up, we're totally committed - meaning we've paid even more attention, are even more resilient, and are way more productive as a result.\"</p>\n<p>Keep your goals to yourself.</p>\n<p>clear goals in the form of daily to-do lists.</p>\n<p>clear goals are an important flow trigger. The state requires focus, and clear goals tell us where and when to put our attention.</p>\n<p>try to write the next day's list at the end of the previous day, limit around eight items.</p>\n<p>Impossible is always a checklist. Do every item on your checklist today, do every time on your checklist tomorrow, and repeat.</p>\n<p>\"No pressure, no diamonds.\"</p>\n<p>intrinsic motivation launches you down the path of peak performance, proper goal setting helps define that path, and grit is what keeps you keeping on despite the odds and obstacles.</p>\n<p>Grit - the intersection of passion and perseverance.</p>\n<p>self-regulation is both the ability to control our emotions and the ability to persist through challenging, strenuous tasks.</p>\n<p>\"All high achievers are paragons of perseverance.\"</p>\n<p>\"Persistence\" is willpower, mindset, and passion.</p>\n<p>Willpower is self-control. It's the ability to resist distraction, stay focused, and delay gratification.</p>\n<p>willpower declines over the course of the day.</p>\n<p>mindset refers to our attitudes toward learning.</p>\n<p>\"If you think you can, or you think you can't, well, you're right.\"</p>\n<p>thought control matters.</p>\n<p>\"There are only two kinds of thoughts, those that constrict us or those that expand us.\"</p>\n<p>Positive self-talk is about choosing those thoughts that provide little more space.</p>\n<p>the positivity ratio - takes three positive thoughts to counter a single negative thought.</p>\n<p>positive self-talk has to be grounded in reality.</p>\n<p>The best way to talk yourself up is to remind yourself of stuff you know is true.</p>\n<p>A daily gratitude practice alters the brain's negativity bias.</p>\n<p>We are most effective at dealing with life's challenges when we're aware, observant, non reactive, and non judgemental.</p>\n<p>It's what you do with that fear that makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>Fear is a fantastic motivator.</p>\n<p>Learning to treat fear as a challenge to rise toward rather than a threat to be avoided can make such a profound difference in our lives.</p>\n<p>Fear drives attention.</p>\n<p>Once you actually put your full attention on the sensation of fear, it dissipates.</p>\n<p>Look at fear as excitement, or as an emotion designed to help you focus.</p>\n<p>learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>use fear as a compass.</p>\n<p>\"The grit that matters most is learning to be your best when you're at your worst.\"</p>\n<p>Excellence always has a cost.</p>\n<p>If your goal is greatness, then you're going to put just about every available hour toward that goal.</p>\n<p>\"The day before something truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea.\"</p>\n<p>The \"habit of ferocity\" is the ability to immediately and automatically rise to any challenge.</p>\n<p>\"Figure out what you would die for, then live for it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sow an action and you reap a habit, sow a habit and you reap a character, sow a character and you reap a destiny.\"</p>\n<p>How we spend our days, of course, how we spend our lives.</p>\n<p>motivation is what gets you into the game, but learning is what keeps you there.</p>\n<p>Before we can begin learning, we need to believe that learning is possible.</p>\n<p>The right mindset prepares the brain for learning, the right \"truth filter\" helps us access and evaluate what is being learned.</p>\n<p>learn to learn faster.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning, then you're interested in books.</p>\n<p>consistently focusing your learning on the 20 percent of information that will make 80 percent of the difference - and doing this over and over again - will absolutely shorten the path to mastery.</p>\n<p>If what we're learning completely aligns with who we are, we speed the plow.
