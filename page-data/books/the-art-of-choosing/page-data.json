Knowledge is always important where there's a choice.\"</p>\n<p>We're reluctant to give up choice in any situation because we believe it enables us to change and shape our lives for the better; on the other hand, we recognize from experience and perhaps from intuition that some choices, no matter which option we choose and what the outcome, will always diminish our happiness.</p>\n<p>We can similarly choose to relinquish our difficult choices to others, which neatly avoids having to decide between the distress or harm that would result from choosing for ourselves and the diminished autonomy that would result from other's restricting our choices without our approval.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Sheena Iyengar"],"seo_description":"The art of choosing by Sheena Iyengar notes.","title":"The Art Of Choosing"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-art-of-choosing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
