The lower the ratio, the less gain-reduction.</p>\n<p>A Sidechain's purpose is to allow the compressor to act as if it were behaving in response to an EQ'd version of the sound you're treating.</p>\n<p>Gain reduction means reducing the volume of a sound.</p>\n<p>Attack is how long it takes our automatic volume fader to move downward when the threshold is exceeded by our incoming signal.</p>\n<p>Release is how long it will take our automatic volume fader to return back to its original position of 0 volume reduction.</p>\n<p>Hold is a way to delay the release phase of our automatic volume fader.</p>\n<p>Makeup Gain allows us to restore our instrument to its original perceived volume level.</p>\n<p>You'll learn that you have frequency pockets which are managed by EQ's and you have volume leveled pockets which are managed by compression. Having these distinct pockets in your mix means your mixes will have more depth, and therefore more blend and contrast.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Nathan Nyquist"],"seo_description":"The EQ and compression formula by Nathan Nyquist notes.","title":"THE EQ AND COMPRESSION FORMULA"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-eq-and-compression-formula/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
