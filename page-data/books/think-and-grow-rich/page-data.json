If you truly <strong>DESIRE</strong> riches so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. Your <strong>BURNING DESIRE</strong> comes from your dreams, you must take action until that dream is a physical reality. There is a difference between <strong>WISHING</strong> for a thing and being <strong>READY</strong> to receive it. No one is <em>ready</em> for a thing, until he <em>believes</em> he can acquire it.</p>\n<h4>My Wage by Jessie B. Rittenhouse</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I bargained with Life for a penny,</p>\n<p>And Life would pay no more,</p>\n<p>However I begged at evening</p>\n<p>When I counted my scanty store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Life is a just employer,</p>\n<p>He gives you what you ask,</p>\n<p>But once you have set the wages,</p>\n<p>Why, you must bear the task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I worked for a menial's hire,</p>\n<p>Only to learn, dismayed,</p>\n<p>That any wage I had asked of Life,</p>\n<p>Life would have willingly paid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>FAITH - VISUALIZATION OF, AND BELIEF IN ATTAINMENT OF DESIRE</h3>\n<p><strong>FAITH</strong> is the head chemist of the mind. The emotions of <strong>FAITH, LOVE</strong>, and <strong>SEX</strong> are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is purely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence. The principle of auto-suggestion assumes in the transmutation of desire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: <strong>FAITH</strong> is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.</p>\n<p><strong>ALL THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, given feeling AND MIXED WITH FAITH</strong>, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart. Understand that the subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive nature.</p>\n<p>Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to encourage the <em>positive emotions</em> as dominating forces of your mind, and discourage - and <em>eliminate</em> negative emotions.</p>\n<p>Every man is what he is, because of the <strong>DOMINATING THOUGHTS</strong> which he permits to occupy his mind.</p>\n<h4>SELF-CONFIDENCE FORMULA</h4>\n<p>First, I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.</p>\n<p>Second. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.</p>\n<p>Third. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.</p>\n<p>Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.</p>\n<p>Fifth. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.</p>\n<h4>THINKING - by Walter D. Wintle</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think you are beaten, you are</p>\n<p>If you think you dare not, you don't,</p>\n<p>If you like to win, but you think you can't</p>\n<p>It is almost certain you won't.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think you'll lose, you're lost</p>\n<p>For out of the world we find,</p>\n<p>Success begins with a fellow's will</p>\n<p>It's all in the state of mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think you are outclassed, you are</p>\n<p>You've got to think high to rise,</p>\n<p>You've got to be sure of yourself before</p>\n<p>You can ever win a prize.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life's battles don't always go</p>\n<p>To the stronger or faster man,</p>\n<p>But soon or late the man who wins</p>\n<p>Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>AUTO-SUGESSTION - THE MEDIUM FOR INFLUENCING THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND</h3>\n<p><strong>AUTO-SUGGESTION</strong> is a term which applies to all suggestions and all self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five senses. Through the dominating thoughts which one <em>permits</em> to remain in the conscious mind, whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is immaterial, the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and influences it with these thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>NO THOUGHT</strong>, whether it be negative or positive, <strong>CAN ENTER THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTO-SUGGESTION</strong>, with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE - PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OR OBSERVATIONS</h3>\n<p>There are two kinds of knowledge. One is general, the other is specialized. <strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong> will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical <strong>PLANS OF ACTION</strong>, to the <strong>DEFINITE END</strong> of accumulation of money.</p>\n<p>Knowledge is only <em>potential</em> power. It becomes power only when and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end.</p>\n<p>An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others.</p>\n<p>Before you can be sure of your ability to transmute <strong>DESIRE</strong> into its monetary equivalent, you will require <strong>SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE</strong> of the service, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for fortune.</p>\n<p>The man who can organize and direct a \"Master Mind\" group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation of money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group.</p>\n<p>Successful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized knowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession.</p>\n<p>The person who stops studying merely because he has finished school is forever hopelessly doomed to mediocrity, no matter what may be his calling. The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of <em>knowledge</em>.</p>\n<p>If you have the <strong>IMAGINATION</strong>, and seek a more profitable outlet for your personal services, the <strong>IDEA</strong> is capable of yielding an income far greater than that of the \"average\" doctor, lawyer, or engineer. Back of all <strong>IDEAS</strong> is specialized knowledge. Capability means <strong>IMAGINATION</strong>, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with <strong>IDEAS</strong>, in the form of <strong>ORGANIZED PLANS</strong> designed to yield riches.</p>\n<h3>IMAGINATION - THE WORKSHOP OF THE MIND</h3>\n<p>The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the <strong>DESIRE</strong>, is given shape, form, and <strong>ACTION</strong> through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind. It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>MAN'S ONLY LIMITATION</strong>, within reason, <strong>LIES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION</strong>.</p>\n<p>Desire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart.</p>\n<p>Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes and are products of the imagination.</p>\n<p><strong>DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE</strong> is the starting point from which one must begin.</p>\n<p><strong>IDEAS CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO CASH THROUGH THE POWER OF DEFINITE PURPOSE, PLUS DEFINITE PLANS.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no standard price on ideas. The creator of ideas makes his own price, and, if he is smart, gets it.</p>\n<h4>Imaginative Faculty Functions In Two Forms</h4>\n<p><strong>SYNTHETIC IMAGINATION:</strong> Through this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combination.</p>\n<p><strong>CREATIVE IMAGINATION:</strong> Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This Earth, every one of the billions of individual cells of your body, and every atom of matter, <em>began as an intangible form of energy</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where there's a will, there's a way</p>\n<h3>ORGANIZED PLANNING - THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF DESIRE INTO ACTION</h3>\n<p>You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the form of <strong>DESIRE</strong>, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the <strong>IMAGINATION</strong>, where <strong>PLANS</strong> for its transition are created and organized.</p>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the creation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.</p>\n<p>b) Before forming your \"Master Mind\" alliance, decide what advantages, and benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for their cooperation.</p>\n<p>c) Arrange to meet with the member of your \"Master Mind\" group at least twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected the necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.</p>\n<p>d) Maintain <strong>PERFECT HARMONY</strong> between yourself and every member of your \"Master Mind\" group.</p>\n<p>No individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and knowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the cooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to accumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other member of your \"Master Mind\" group.</p>\n<p>The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money - nor in any other undertaking - without plans which are practical and workable.</p>\n<p>Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that there is something wrong with your plan.</p>\n<p><strong>NO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING \"TEMPORARY DEFEAT.\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A QUITTER NEVER WINS AND A WINNER NEVER QUITS.</strong></p>\n<p>There are two types of people in the world. One type is known as <strong>LEADERS</strong> and the other as <strong>FOLLOWERS</strong>. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They became great leaders because they were <strong>INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Major Attributes Of Leadership</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>UNWAVERING COURAGE</strong> based upon knowledge of self, and of one's occupation.</li>\n<li><strong>SELF-CONTROL</strong>. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others.</li>\n<li><strong>A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE</strong>. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.</li>\n<li><strong>DEFINITENESS OF DECISION</strong>. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself.</li>\n<li><strong>DEFINITENESS OF PLANS</strong>. The successful leader must plan his work and <em>work his plan</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR</strong>. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.</li>\n<li><strong>A PLEASING PERSONALITY</strong>. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader.</li>\n<li><strong>SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING</strong>. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers, moreover, he must understand them and their problems.</li>\n<li><strong>MASTERY OF DETAIL</strong>. Successful leadership call for mastery of details of the leader's position.</li>\n<li><strong>WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY</strong>. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers.</li>\n<li><strong>COOPERATION</strong>. Leadership calls for <strong>POWER</strong>, and power calls for <strong>COOPERATION</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Leadership-by-consent</em> of the followers is the only brand which can endure!</p>\n<h4>QQS Rating</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><em>QUALITY</em> of service shall be construed to mean the performance of every detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner possible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.</li>\n<li><em>QUANTITY</em> of service shall be understood to mean the <strong>HABIT</strong> of rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of services rendered as greater skill is developed through practice and experience.</li>\n<li><em>SPIRIT</em> of service shall be construed to mean the <strong>HABIT</strong> of agreeable, harmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow employees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If one has a personality which <strong>PLEASES</strong>, and renders service in a spirit of <strong>HARMONY</strong>, these assets often make up for deficiencies in both the <strong>QUALITY</strong>, and the <strong>QUANTITY</strong> of service one renders.</p>\n<h4>Thirty Major Causes Of Failure</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND</li>\n<li>LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED PURPOSE IN LIFE</li>\n<li>LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY</li>\n<li>INSUFFICIENT EDUCTION</li>\n<li>LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE</li>\n<li>ILL HEALTH</li>\n<li>UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES DURING CHILDHOOD</li>\n<li>PROCRASTINATION</li>\n<li>LACK OF PERSISTENCE</li>\n<li>NEGATIVE PERSONALITY</li>\n<li>LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE</li>\n<li>UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR \"SOMETHING FOR NOTHING\"</li>\n<li>LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION</li>\n<li>ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS</li>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE</li>\n<li>OVER-CAUTION</li>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES</li>\n<li>SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE</li>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION</li>\n<li>LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT</li>\n<li>THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING</li>\n<li>LACK OF ENTHUSIASM</li>\n<li>INTOLERANCE</li>\n<li>INTEMPERANCE</li>\n<li>INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS</li>\n<li>POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED THROUGH SELF EFFORT</li>\n<li>INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY</li>\n<li>EGOTISM AND VANITY</li>\n<li>GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING</li>\n<li>LACK OF CAPITAL</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy of life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails.</p>\n<p>Annual self-analysis is an essential in the effective marketing of personal services. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to move forward even if the progress is slow. Your annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you can include in your New Year's Resolutions any improvements which the analysis indicates should be made.</p>\n<h4>SELF-ANALYSIS QUESTIONNAIRE FOR PERSONAL INVENTORY</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Have I attained the goal which I established as my objective for this year? You should work with a definite yearly objective to be attained as a part of your major life objective.</li>\n<li>Have I delivered service of the best possible <strong>QUALITY</strong> of which I was capable, or could I have improved any part of this service?</li>\n<li>Have I delivered service in the greatest possible <strong>QUANTITY</strong> of which I was capable?</li>\n<li>Has the spirit of my conduct been harmonious, and cooperative at all times?</li>\n<li>Have I permitted the habit of <strong>PROCRASTINATION</strong> to decrease my efficiency, and if so, to what extent?</li>\n<li>Have I improved my <strong>PERSONALITY</strong>, and if so, in what ways?</li>\n<li>Have I been <strong>PERSISTENT</strong> in following my plans through to completion?</li>\n<li>Have I reached <strong>DECISIONS PROMPTLY AND DEFINITELY</strong> on all occasions?</li>\n<li>Have I permitted any one or more of the six basic fears to decrease my efficiency?</li>\n<li>Have I been either \"over-cautious,\" or \"under-cautious?\"</li>\n<li>Has my relationship with my associates in work been pleasant, or unpleasant? If it has been unpleasant, has the fault been partly, or wholly mine?</li>\n<li>Have I dissipated any of my energy through lack of <strong>CONCENTRATION</strong> of effort?</li>\n<li>Have I been open minded and tolerant in connection with all subjects?</li>\n<li>In what way have I improved my ability to render service?</li>\n<li>Have I been intemperate in any of my habits?</li>\n<li>Have I expressed, either openly or secretly, and from of <strong>EGOTISM</strong>?</li>\n<li>Has my conduct toward my associates been such that has induced them to <strong>RESPECT</strong> me?</li>\n<li>Have my opinions and <strong>DECISIONS</strong> been based upon guesswork, or accuracy of analysis and <strong>THOUGHT</strong>?</li>\n<li>Have I followed the habit of budgeting my time, my expenses, and my income, and have I been conservative in these budgets?</li>\n<li>How much time have I devoted to <strong>UNPROFITABLE</strong> effort which I might have used to better advantage?</li>\n<li>How many I <strong>RE-BUDGET</strong> my time, and change my habits so I will be more efficient during the coming year?</li>\n<li>Have I been guilty of any conduct which was not approved by my conscience?</li>\n<li>In what ways have I rendered <strong>MORE SERVICE AND BETTER SERVICE</strong> than I was paid to render?</li>\n<li>Have I been unfair to anyone, and if so, in what way?</li>\n<li>If I had been the purchaser of my own services for the year, would I be satisfied with my purchase?</li>\n<li>Am I in the right vocation, and if not, why not?</li>\n<li>Has the purchaser of my services been satisfied with the service I have rendered, and if not, why not?</li>\n<li>What is my present rating on the fundamental principles of success? Make this rating fairly, and frankly, and have it checked by someone who is courageous enough to do it accurately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Those who have lost their fortunes, and those who are just beginning to earn money, have nothing but personal services to offer in return for riches, therefore it is essential that they have available the practical information needed to market services to best advantage.</p>\n<p>The United States of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small, let us remember, <em>all of us</em>, that we live in a country where <em>every law-abiding citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled anywhere in the world</em>. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes <strong>FOOD, CLOTHING</strong>, and <strong>SHELTER</strong>, the three basic necessities of life.</p>\n<p>There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service. No system has ever been created by which men can legally acquire riches through mere force of numbers, or without giving in return an equivalent value of one form or another.</p>\n<p>America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate riches that any honest person may require. We shall prefer to continue with our <strong>FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF DEED</strong>, AND <strong>FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR RICHES</strong>, The \"System\" denies no one this right, but it does not, and cannot promise <strong>SOMETHING FOR NOTHING</strong>, because the system, itself, is irrevocably controlled by the <strong>LAW OF ECONOMICS</strong> which neither recognizes nor tolerates for long <strong>GETTING WITHOUT GIVING</strong>.</p>\n<h3>DECISION - THE MASTERY OF PROCRASTINATION</h3>\n<p><strong>ACCURATE</strong> analysis of over 25,000 men and women who had experienced failure, disclosed the face that <strong>LACK OF DECISION</strong> was near the head of the list of the 30 major causes of <strong>FAILURE</strong>. <strong>PROCRASTINATION</strong>, the opposite of <strong>DECISION</strong>, is a common enemy which practically every man must conquer.</p>\n<p>Get into the habit of <strong>REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY</strong>, and of changing these decisions <strong>SLOWLY</strong>, if, and when they were changed.</p>\n<p>Opinions are the cheapest commodities on Earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by \"opinions\" when you reach <strong>DECISIONS</strong>, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting <strong>YOUR OWN DESIRE</strong> into money.</p>\n<p>You have a brain and mind of your own, <strong>USE IT</strong>, and reach your own decisions. Keep your eyes and ears wide open - and your mouth <strong>CLOSED</strong>, if you wish to acquire the habit of prompt <strong>DECISION</strong>. Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through <em>modesty and silence</em>. Let one of your first decisions be to <strong>KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND OPEN EARS AND EYES</strong>.</p>\n<p>You will find only the eternal laws of Nature. These laws are available to every person who has the <strong>FAITH</strong> and the <strong>COURAGE</strong> to use them. Those who reach <strong>DECISIONS</strong> promptly and definitely, know what they want, and generally get it. The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.</p>\n<p><strong>INDECISION</strong> is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on permanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even through college, without <strong>DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE</strong>. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any job that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into the habit of <strong>INDECISION</strong>. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for wages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the <strong>DEFINITENESS OF DECISION</strong> to <strong>PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION</strong>, and the knowledge of how to choose an employer.</p>\n<p>The person who reaches a <strong>DEFINITE DECISION</strong> to procure the particular job, and make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he stakes his <strong>ECONOMIC FREEDOM</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the chapter on Organized Planning, you will find complete instructions for marketing every type of personal services. You will find also detailed information on how to choose the employer you prefer, and the particular job you desire. These instructions will be of no value to you <strong>UNLESS YOU DEFINITELY DECIDE</strong> to organize them into a plan of actions.</p>\n<h3>PERSISTENCE - THE SUSTAINED EFFORT NECESSARY TO INDUCE FAITH</h3>\n<p><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong> is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting <strong>DESIRE</strong> into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the <strong>POWER OF WILL</strong>.</p>\n<p>Will-power and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible pair. The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes overboard, and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry on <strong>DESPITE</strong> all opposition, until they attain their goal. The ease with which lack of persistence may be conquered will depend <em>entirely</em> upon the <strong>INTENSITY OF ONE'S DESIRE</strong>. If you find yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness may be remedied by building a stronger fire under your desires.</p>\n<p>Without <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong>, you will be defeated, even before you start. With <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong> you will win.</p>\n<p>Be <strong>PERSISTENT</strong> no matter how slowly you may, at first, have to move. <strong>WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS</strong>. <strong>THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE.</strong></p>\n<p>A few people know from experience the soundness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat as being anything more than temporary. They are the ones whose <strong>DESIRES</strong> are so <strong>PERSISTENTLY APPLIED</strong> that defeat is finally changed into victory. We who stand on the side-lines of Life see the overwhelmingly large number who go down in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who take the punishment of defeat <em>as an urge to greater effort</em>. These, fortuneately, never learn to accept Life's reverse gear. But what we <strong>DO NOT SEE</strong>, what most of us never suspect of existing, is the silent but irresistible <strong>POWER</strong> which comes to the rescue of those who fight on in the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we call it <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong>. One thing we all know, if one does not proccess <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong>, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling.</p>\n<h4>Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated, like all states of mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE</li>\n<li>DESIRE</li>\n<li>SELF-RELIANCE</li>\n<li>DEFINITENESS OF PLANS</li>\n<li>ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE</li>\n<li>CO-OPERATION</li>\n<li>WILL-POWER</li>\n<li>HABIT</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Study the list below carefully, and face yourself squarely <strong>IF YOU REALLY WISH TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.</strong></p>\n<h4>SYMPTOMS OF LACK OF PERSISTENCE</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Failure to recognize and to clearly define exactly what one wants.</li>\n<li>Procrastination with or without cause.</li>\n<li>Lack of interest in acquiring specialized knowledge.</li>\n<li>Indecision the habit of \"passing the buck\" on all occasions, instead of facing issues squarely.</li>\n<li>The habit of relying upon alibis instead of creating definite plans for the solution of problems.</li>\n<li>Self-satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this affliction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.</li>\n<li>Indifference, usually reflected in one's readiness to compromise on all occasions, rather than meet opposition and fight it.</li>\n<li>The habit of blaming others for one's mistakes, and accepting unfavorable circumstances as being unavoidable.</li>\n<li><strong>WEAKNESS OF DESIRE</strong>, due to neglect in the choice of <strong>MOTIVES</strong> that impel action.</li>\n<li>Willingness, even eagerness, to quit at the first sign of defeat.</li>\n<li>Lack of <strong>ORGANIZED PLANS</strong>, placed in writing where they may be analyzed,</li>\n<li>The habit of neglecting to move on ideas, or to grasp opportunity when it presents itself.</li>\n<li><strong>WISHING</strong> instead of <strong>WILLING</strong>.</li>\n<li>The habit of compromising with <strong>POVERTY</strong> instead of aiming at riches. General absence of ambition to <em>be, to do</em>, and to <em>own</em>.</li>\n<li>Searching for all the short-cuts to riches, trying to <strong>GET</strong> without <strong>GIVING</strong> a fair equivalent, usually reflected in the habit of gambling, endeavoring to drive \"sharp\" bargains.</li>\n<li><strong>FEAR OF CRITICISM</strong>, failure to create plans and to put them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or say.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>MOST IDEAS ARE STILL-BORN, AND NEED THE BREATH OF LIFE INJECTED INTO THEM THROUGH DEFINITE PLANS OF IMMEDIATE ACTION</strong>.</p>\n<p>The only \"break\" anyone can afford to rely upon is a self-made \"break.\" These come through the application of <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong>. The starting point is <strong>DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Examine the first hundred people you meet, ask them what they want most in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you press them for an answer, some will say <strong>SECURITY</strong>, many will say <strong>MONEY</strong>, a few will say <strong>HAPPINESS</strong>, other will say <strong>FAME AND POWER</strong>, and still others will say <strong>SOCIAL RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING, DANCE</strong>, or <strong>WRITE</strong>, but none of them will be able to define these terms, or give the slightest indication of a <strong>PLAN</strong> by which they hope to attain these vaguely expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant <strong>PERSISTENCE</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Four Simple Steps To Develop Persistence</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS ACTION.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These four steps are essential for success in all walks of life. The entire purpose of the thirteen principles of this philosophy is to enable one to take these four steps as a matter of <em>habit</em>.</p>\n<h3>POWER OF THE MASTER MIND - THE DRIVING FORCE</h3>\n<p><strong>POWER</strong> is essential for success in the accumulation of money. <strong>PLANS</strong> are inert and useless, without sufficient <strong>POWER</strong> to translate them into <strong>ACTION</strong>. Power, as the term is here used, refers to <strong>ORGANIZED</strong> effort, sufficient to enable an individual to transmute <strong>DESIRE</strong> into its monetary equivalent. <strong>ORGANIZED</strong> effort is produced through the coordination of effort of two or more people, who work toward a <strong>DEFINITE</strong> end, in a spirit of harmony.</p>\n<p><strong>POWER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY! POWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE RETENTION OF MONEY AFTER IT HAS BEEN ACCUMULATED!</strong></p>\n<p>The \"Master Mind\" may be defined as: \"Coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose.\"</p>\n<p>The human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature. When the mind of two people are coordinated in a <strong>SPIRIT OF HARMONY</strong>, the spiritual unit of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the \"psychic\" phase of the Master Mind.</p>\n<p><strong>ENERGY</strong> is Nature's universal set of building blocks, out of which she constructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of animal and vegetable life. Nature's building blocks are available to man in the energy involved in <strong>THINKING!</strong> Man's brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs energy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and fills the entire universe. It is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery. A group of brains coordinated or connected in a spirit of harmony, will provide more thought-energy than a single brain, just as a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery.</p>\n<p>Men take on the nature and the habits and the <strong>POWER OF THOUGHT</strong> of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony.</p>\n<p>When two or more people coordinate in a spirit of <strong>HARMONY</strong>, and work toward a definite objective, they place themselves in position, through that alliance, to absorb power directly from the great universal storehouse of Infinite Intelligence.</p>\n<p>When riches take the place of poverty, the change is usually brought about through well conceived and carefully executed <strong>PLANS</strong>. Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it, because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be \"attracted.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anybody can wish for riches,</p>\n<p>and most people do,</p>\n<p>but only a few know that a definite plan,</p>\n<p>plus a burning desire for wealth,</p>\n<p>are the only dependable means of accumulating wealth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>THE MYSTERY OF SEX TRANSMUTATION - THE TENTH STEP TOWARD RICHES</h3>\n<p>The meaning of the word \"transmute\" is, in simple language, \"the changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another.\" Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other nature.</p>\n<p>Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, man develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times.</p>\n<p>Fortune, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.</p>\n<p>The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman.</p>\n<p>The emotion of sex is an \"irresistible force,\" against which there can be no such opposition as an \"immovable body.\" When driven by this emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action.</p>\n<h4>Ten Mind Stimuli</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The desire for sex expression</li>\n<li>Love</li>\n<li>A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY</li>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.</li>\n<li>A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.</li>\n<li>Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.</li>\n<li>Auto-suggestion</li>\n<li>Fear</li>\n<li>Narcotics and alcohol</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli, that transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius.</p>\n<p>The sixth sense is \"Creative Imagination.\" The faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usually happens by mere accident. The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. The \"sixth sense\" is the faculty which marks the difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.</p>\n<p>The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great because they acquire the habit of relying upon the \"still small voice\" which speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination.</p>\n<p>The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire.</p>\n<p>Sex energy is the creative energy for all genii, <em>There never has been, and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex</em>. Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the creative faculty of the imagination.</p>\n<p>The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are filled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age of man. Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn if he ever learns, the art of sex transmutation.</p>\n<p>When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted and totally destructive. When driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of <strong>LOVE</strong> is used with the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.</p>\n<p>Reformation means, \"a change of heart.\" It does not mean a \"change of head.\" A man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but <strong>GENUINE REFORMATION</strong> comes only through a change of heart-through a <strong>DESIRE</strong> to change.</p>\n<p>Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to heights of super achievement, when combined, these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius.</p>\n<p>The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the <em>dominating</em> thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's thoughts.</p>\n<p>The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one's very soul, even after the fire has been subdued by time and circumstance. Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, ,and influence long after the source of stimulation has faded. Every person, who has been moved by <strong>GENUINE LOVE</strong>, knows that it leaves enduring traces upon the human heart.</p>\n<p>Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane. When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are removed. Then a genius has been born!</p>\n<p>It is a very old saying that \"a man's wife may either make him or break him,\" but the reason is not always understood. The \"making\" and \"breaking\" is the result of the wife's understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions of love, sex, and romance.</p>\n<p>Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man.</p>\n<p><strong>NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN.</strong></p>\n<h3>THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND - THE CONNECTING LINK</h3>\n<p><strong>THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND</strong> consists of a field of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet. You may <strong>VOLUNTARILY</strong> plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.</p>\n<p><strong>THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT.</strong> Through a method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes one's desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most practical media by which this end may be accomplished.</p>\n<p>Remember, your subconscious mind functions voluntarily, <em>whether you make any effort to influence it or not.</em> This, naturally, suggests to you that thoughts of fear and poverty, and all negative thoughts serve as stimuli to your subconscious mind, <em>unless</em>, you master these impulses and give it more desirable food upon which it may feed. You are now engaged in trying to help shut oil the flow of negative impulses, and to aid in voluntarily influencing your subconscious mind, through positive impulses of <strong>DESIRE</strong>.</p>\n<p>All thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical equivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass through the imagination, and be mixed with faith.</p>\n<h4>You Never Can Tell by Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You never can tell when you send a word,</p>\n<p>Like an arrow shot from a bow</p>\n<p>By an archer blind, be it cruel or kind,</p>\n<p>Just where it may chance to go.</p>\n<p>It may pierce the breast of your dearest friend.</p>\n<p>Tipped with its poison or balm,</p>\n<p>To a stranger's heart in life's great mart,</p>\n<p>It may carry its pain or its calm.</p>\n<p>You never can tell when you do an act</p>\n<p>Just what the result will be;</p>\n<p>But with every deed you are sowing a seed,</p>\n<p>Though the harvest you may not see.</p>\n<p>Each kindly act is an acorn dropped</p>\n<p>In God's productive soil</p>\n<p>You may not know, but the tree shall grow,</p>\n<p>With shelter for those who toil.</p>\n<p>You never can tell what your thoughts will do,</p>\n<p>In bringing you hate or love;</p>\n<p>For thoughts are things, and their airy wings</p>\n<p>Are swifter than carrier doves.</p>\n<p>They follow the law of the universe</p>\n<p>Each thing must create its kind,</p>\n<p>And they speed o'er the track to bring you back</p>\n<p>Whatever went out from your mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thoughts are truly things, for the reason that every material thing begins in the form of thought-energy.</p>\n<p>There are seven major positive emotions, and seven major negative emotions. The negatives <em>voluntarily</em> inject themselves into the thought impulses, which insure passage into the subconscious mind. The positives must be injected, through the principle of auto-suggestion, into the thought impulses which an individual wishes to pass on to his subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>The seven major positive emotions are <strong>DESIRE, FAITH, LOVE, SEX, ENTHUSIASM, ROMANCE</strong>, and <strong>HOPE</strong>. The seven major negative emotions to be avoided are <strong>FEAR, JEALOUSY, HATRED, REVENGE, GREED, SUPERSTITION</strong>, and <strong>ANGER</strong>.</p>\n<p>Positive and negative emotions cannot occupy the mind at the same time. One or the other must dominate, it's your responsibility to make sure that positive emotions constitute the dominating influence of your mind. Form the habit of applying and using the positive emotions!</p>\n<p>The subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one's prayers into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognize, presents the message, and brings back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the object of the prayer.</p>\n<p>Faith is the only known agency which will give your thoughts a spiritual nature. <strong>FAITH</strong> and <strong>FEAR</strong> make poor bedfellows. <em>Where one is found, the other cannot exist</em>.</p>\n<h3>THE BRAIN - A BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING STATION FOR THOUGHT</h3>\n<p>Through the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by the radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of picking up vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains. The Creative Imagination is the \"receiving set\" of the brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. it is the agency of communication between one's conscious, or reasoning mind, and the four sources from which one may receive thought stimuli.</p>\n<p>Vibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up and carried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy travelling at an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has been modified or \"stepped up\" by any of the major emotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than ordinary thought, and it is this type of thought which passes from one brain to another, through the broadcasting machinery of the human brain. The brain which has been stimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid rate than it does when that emotion is quiescent or absent.</p>\n<p>The subconscious mind is the \"sending station\" of the brain, through which vibrations of thought are broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the \"receiving set,\" through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the ether.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GREATEST FORCES ARE \"INTANGIBLE\".</strong> Through the ages which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and has limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh, and measure. We shall learn, as we pass through this age, that the \"other self\" is more powerful than the physical self we see when we look into a mirror.</p>\n<p>The things men cannot perceive through any of their five senses, and when we hear them, it should remind us that <em>all of us are controlled by forces which are unseen and intangible</em>.</p>\n<h3>THE SIXTH SENSE - THE DOOR TO THE TEMPLE OF WISDOM</h3>\n<p>The \"thirteenth\" principle is known as the <strong>SIXTH SENSE</strong>, through which Infinite Intelligence may, and will communicate voluntarily, without any effort from, or demands by, the individual. The <strong>SIXTH SENSE</strong> is that portion of the subconscious mind which has been referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the \"receiving set\" through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind. The \"flashes\" are sometimes called \"hunches\" or \"inspirations.\" The sixth sense probably is the medium of contact between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence, and for this reason, <em>it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual</em>.</p>\n<p>All men have become what they are, because of their <strong>DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND DESIRES</strong>.</p>\n<p>The sixth sense is nothing something that one can take off and put on at will. Ability to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other principles outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable knowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty or pass fifty, for the reason that the spiritual forces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become usable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious thought.</p>\n<p>The starting point of all achievement is <strong>DESIRE</strong>. The finishing point is that brand of <strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong> which leads to understanding - understanding of self, understanding of others, understanding of the laws of Nature, recognition and understanding of <strong>HAPPINESS</strong>.</p>\n<h2>MASTERY OF FEAR</h2>\n<p>Here will be found a full description of the six fears which are the cause of all discouragement, timidity, procrastination, indifference, indecision, and the lack of ambition, self-reliance, initiative, self-control, and enthusiasm.</p>\n<h3>HOW TO OUTWIT THE SIX GHOSTS OF FEAR</h3>\n<p>It begins with study, analysis, and understanding of three enemies which you shall have to clear out. They are <strong>INDECISION, DOUBT</strong>, and <strong>FEAR!</strong> The Sixth Sense will never function while these three negatives, or any of them remain in your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>INDECISION</strong> is the seedling of <strong>FEAR!</strong> Indecision crystalizes into <strong>DOUBT</strong>, the two blend and become <strong>FEAR!</strong></p>\n<p>There are six basic fears they are <strong>POVERTY, CRITICISM, ILL HEALTH, LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE, OLD AGE,</strong> and <strong>DEATH</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Fears are nothing more than states of mind.</em> Fears paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of imagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages initiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out enthusiasm, and makes self-control an impossibility.</p>\n<p><strong>MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Every human being has the ability to completely control his own mind.</em></p>\n<p>The obvious truth that we live in a world of over-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing between us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose.</p>\n<p>Self-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to acknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life more than mediocrity and poverty. Only a courageous analysis will disclose the presence of this universal enemy.</p>\n<p>The entire world is made up of only two things, <strong>ENERGY</strong> and <strong>MATTER</strong>. In elementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy can be created nor destroyed, and both can be transformed. Life is energy, like other forms of energy, may be passed through various processes of transition, or change, but it cannot be destroyed.</p>\n<p>The six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through indecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching a decision to accept death as a inescapable event. Whip the fear of poverty by reaching a decision to get along with whatever wealth you can accumulate <strong>WITHOUT WORRY</strong>. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of criticism by reaching a decision <strong>NOT TO WORRY</strong> about what other people think, do, or say. Eliminate the fear of old age by reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a great blessing which carries with it wisdom, self-control, and understanding not known to youth. Acquit yourself of the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms. Master the fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love, if that is necessary. Kill the habit of worry, in all its form, by reaching a general, blanket decision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price of worry. With this decision will come poise, peace of mind, and calmness of thought which will bring happiness.</p>\n<p>A man whose mind is filled with fear not only destroys his own chances of intelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of all who come into contact with him, and destroys, also their chances.</p>\n<p>Your business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be successful, you must find peace of mind, acquire the material needs of life, and above all, attain <strong>HAPPINESS</strong>. All of these evidences of success begin in the form of thought impulses.</p>\n<p>You are the master of your own earthly destiny just as surely as you have the power to control your own thoughts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which people suffer. <strong>IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL THAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS.</strong> For want of a better name, let us call this evil <strong>SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES</strong>. Men who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this evil! Its weapon is intangible, because it consists of merely a <strong>STATE OF MIND</strong>. To protect yourself against negative influences, whether of your own making, or the result of the activities of negative people around you, recognize that you have a <strong>WILL-POWER</strong>, and put it into constant use, until it builds a will of immunity against negative influences in your own mind.</p>\n<p>Deliberately seek the company of people who influence you to <strong>THINK AND ACT FOR YOURSELF</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Without doubt, the most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people.</em> This weakness is all the more damaging, because most people do not recognize that they are cursed by it, and many who acknowledge it, neglect or refuse to correct the evil until it becomes an uncontrollable part of their daily habits.</p>\n<p>You have <strong>ABSOLUTE CONTROL</strong> over but one thing, and that is your thoughts. Man's Divine nature which you may control your own destiny. <em>Your mind is your spiritual estate!</em>, protect and use it with care. Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either control your mind or it controls you.</p>\n<p>People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They know <em>all the reasons for failure</em>, and have what they believe to be air-tight alibis to explain away their own lack of achievement. I had the courage to see myself as I really am, I would <em>find out what is wrong with me, and correct it,</em> then I might have a chance to profit by my mistakes and learn something from the experience of others, for I know that is something <strong>WRONG</strong> with me, or I would now be where I <em>WOULD HAVE BEEN IF</em> I had spent more time analyzing my weaknesses, and less time building alibis to cover them.</p>\n<p>\"The first and best victory is to conquer self. To be conquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile.\"</p>\n<p>\"Life is a checkerboard, and the player opposite you is <strong>TIME</strong>. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move promptly, your men will be wiped off the board by <strong>TIME</strong>. You are playing against a partner who will not tolerate <strong>INDECISION</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of creating, <em>in your own mind</em>, a <strong>BURNING DESIRE</strong> for a definite form of riches. There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you do not use it. The price is <strong>FAILURE</strong>. There is a reward of stupendous proportions if you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who <em>conquer self and force Life to pay whatever is asked</em>.</p>\n<h3>SELF-ANALYSIS TEST QUESTIONS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you complain often of \"feeling bad,\" and if so, what is the cause?</li>\n<li>Do you find fault with other people at the slightest provocation?</li>\n<li>Do you frequently make mistakes in your work, and if so, why?</li>\n<li>Are you sarcastic and offensive in your conversation?</li>\n<li>Do you deliberately avoid the association of anyone, and if so, why?</li>\n<li>Do you suffer frequently with indigestion?
