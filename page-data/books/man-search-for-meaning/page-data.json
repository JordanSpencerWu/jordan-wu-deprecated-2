The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Three possible sources for meaning: in work doing something significant, in love caring for another person, and in courage during difficult times.</p>\n<p>Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't aim at success, the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run, in the long run, I say! success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The truth, that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.</p>\n<p>Man, can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.</p>\n<p>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedom, to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.</p>\n<p>If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.</p>\n<p>Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.</p>\n<p>Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.</p>\n<p>Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man, his courage and hope, or lack of them, and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.</p>\n<p>We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.</p>\n<p>Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.</p>\n<p>That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.</p>\n<p>What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.</p>\n<p>There are two races of men in this world, but only these two, the \"race\" of the decent man and the \"race\" of the indecent man.</p>\n<p>Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a \"secondary rationalization\" of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significant which will satisfy his own will to meaning.</p>\n<p>Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.</p>\n<p>The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.</p>\n<p>Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone's task is as unique as is specific opportunity to implement it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can discover the meaning in life in three different ways; 1) by creating a work or doing a deed; 2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Man, does not simple exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. Every human has the freedom to change at any instant. Man, is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Man, has both potentialities within himself: which one is actualized depends on decision but not on conditions.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Viktor E.
