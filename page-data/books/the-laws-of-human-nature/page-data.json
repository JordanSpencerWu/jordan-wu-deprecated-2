And the greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become.</p>\n<p>What make us develop these empathic powers is necessity.</p>\n<p>realize you have a remarkable social tool that you are not cultivating, pay deeper attention to people.</p>\n<h3>See Through People's Masks</h3>\n<p>the mind and the body operate together, in ways we are hardly aware of.</p>\n<p>Words are often used as a cover-up, a way to conceal what is really going on.</p>\n<p>nonverbal communication cannot be experienced simply through thinking and translating thoughts into words but must be felt physically as one engages with the facial expressions or looked positions of other people.</p>\n<p>We are the preeminent social animal on the planet, depending on our ability to communicate with others for our survival and success.</p>\n<p>you must recognize your state of self-absorption and have little you actually observe.</p>\n<p>We humans are consummate actors.</p>\n<p>\"All the World's a stage, and all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts.\"</p>\n<p>Remember that everything people do is a sign of some sort; there is no such thing as a gesture that does not communicate.</p>\n<p>Remember that people are generally trying to present the best possible front to the world.</p>\n<p>three categories of the most important cues to observe and identify are dislike / like, dominance / submission, and deception.</p>\n<p>Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater whomever they please.</p>\n<p>We humans are by nature quite gullible.</p>\n<p>A person who is truly authentic doesn't need to play a role in life, we think, but can simply be him - or herself.</p>\n<p>Master the nonverbal cues</p>\n<p>Be a method actor. In method acting you train yourself to be able to display the proper emotions on command.</p>\n<p>Adapt to your audience, know your audience and shape your nonverbal cues to their style and taste.</p>\n<p>Create the proper first impression, looking people in the eye in these first encounters can do wonders for lowering their natural resistance.</p>\n<p>Use dramatic effects, this involves mastering the art of presence / absence.</p>\n<p>Project saintly qualities, you want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works.</p>\n<h3>Determine the Strength of People's Characters</h3>\n<p>We are poorly equipped to gauge the character of the people we deal with.</p>\n<p>Train yourself to ignore the front that people display, the myth that surrounds them, and plumb their depths for signs of their characters.</p>\n<p>A person of strong character is like gold - rare but invaluable.</p>\n<p>it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character.</p>\n<p>Character is something that is so deeply ingrained or stamped within us that it compels us to act in certain ways, beyond our awareness and control.</p>\n<p>you must come to understand your own character, examining as best you can the elements in your past that have gone into forming it, and the patterns, mostly negative, that you can see recurring in your life.</p>\n<p>you must develop your skills in reading the character of the people you deal with.</p>\n<p>The ability to observe people's character - as seen in their actions and patterns - is absolutely critical social skill.</p>\n<p>people never do something just once.</p>\n<p>\"Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool that repeats his folly.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you want to test a man's character, give him power.\"</p>\n<p>introverts and extroverts do not naturally understand each other.</p>\n<p>weak character will neutralize all of the other possible good qualities a person might possess.</p>\n<p>People of real strength are as rare as gold, and if you find them, you should respond as if you had discovered a treasure.</p>\n<p>you have a set character.</p>\n<h3>Become an Elusive Object of Desire</h3>\n<p>to think of the audience first and to strategize how to play on their imagination.</p>\n<p>surround yourself in an aura of mystery.</p>\n<p>They were desirable because someone else desired them.</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing on what you want and covet in the world, you must train yourself to focus on others, on their repressed desires and unmet fantasies.</p>\n<p>People do not want truth and honesty; they want their imaginations to be stimulated and to be taken beyond their circumstances.</p>\n<p>grass-is-always-greener syndrome - if we get too close to the grass to that new object, we see that it is not really so green after all.</p>\n<p>induction, how something positive generates a contrasting negative image in our mind.</p>\n<p>Reality can be quite harsh and is full of limits and problems.</p>\n<p>Our imagination is essentially limitless.</p>\n<p>We become creatures who are continually prone to imagining something better than present circumstances and feeling some pleasure in the release from reality that our imagination brings us.</p>\n<p>Know how and when to withdraw.</p>\n<p>The more active our imagination becomes, the greater the pleasure we derive from it.</p>\n<p>Create rivalries of desire.</p>\n<p>it is not possession but desire that secretly impels people.</p>\n<p>Our path must always be toward greater awareness of our nature.</p>\n<p>What you really must covet is a deeper relationship to reality, which will bring you calmness, focus, and practical powers to alter what it is possible to alter.</p>\n<h3>Elevate Your Perspective</h3>\n<p>When people lost the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality.</p>\n<p>We humans tend to live in the moment.</p>\n<p>in the present moment we lack perspective.</p>\n<p>with the passage of time, we gain more information and see more of the truth; what was invisible to us in the present now becomes visible in retrospect.</p>\n<p>Time is the greatest teacher of them all, the revealer of reality.</p>\n<p>We force ourselves to look at the overall context of the event, not just what immediately grabs our attention.</p>\n<p>A process that involves distance from the present, a deeper look at the source of problems, a wider perspective on the overall context of the situation, and a look further into the future - including the consequences of our actions and our own long-term priorities.</p>\n<p>Short-term thinking is hardwired into our system; we are built to respond to what is immediate and to seek out instant gratification.</p>\n<p>Avoid deep contact with those whose time frame is narrow, who are in continual react mode, and strive to associate with those with an expanded awareness of time.</p>\n<p>alarmed by something in the present, we grab for a solution without thinking deeply about the context, the root of the problem, the possible unintended consequences that might ensure.</p>\n<p>Win through your actions, not your words.</p>\n<p>We must develop patience, which is like a muscle that requires training and repetition to make it strong.</p>\n<p>When faced with issues that are important, we must have a clear sense of our long-term goals and how to attain them.</p>\n<p>It is important to have faith that time will eventually prove us right and to maintain our resolve.</p>\n<p>To reach the greater potential of the human animal, is to widen your relationship to time as much as possible, and slow it down.</p>\n<p>Time is your great teacher and master.</p>\n<p>Think deeply about your long-term goals, they are not vague dreams but concrete objectives, and you have mapped out a path to reach them.</p>\n<h3>Soften People's Resistance by Confirming Their Soft-opinion</h3>\n<p>Put the focus on others.</p>\n<p>Creating this feeling of validation is the golden key that will unlock people's defenses.</p>\n<p>We must discover the power that we can possess by giving people the validation they crave and lowering their defenses.</p>\n<p>People have a perception about themselves that we shall call their self-opinion, what matters is how people perceive their own character and worthiness.</p>\n<p>\"I am autonomous, acting of my own free will.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am intelligent in my own way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am basically good and decent.\"</p>\n<p>Our self-opinion is primary; it determines so much of our thinking and our values.</p>\n<p>instill in people a feeling of inner security.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transform yourself into a deep listener.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are more interested in our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences than in those of the other person.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Infect people with the proper mood.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You do not judge other people; you accept them as they are.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Confirm their self-opinion: Autonomy, Intelligence, Goodness</li>\n<li>Allay their insecurities.</li>\n<li>Use people's resistance and stubbornness.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>people often won't do what others ask them to do, because they simple want to assert their will.</p>\n<p>our intelligence depends on the ability to absorb the lessons and ideas of those who are older and wiser.</p>\n<h3>Change Your Circumstances by Changing Your Attitude</h3>\n<p>no more bowing and apologizing to people; no more complaining and blaming; no more disorderly living and wasting time.</p>\n<p>The freedom that we all experienced came from a choice, a different way of looking at the world, a change in attitude.</p>\n<p>By accepting people, by understanding and it possible even loving them for their human nature, we can liberate our minds from obsessive and pretty emotions.</p>\n<p>Through our work and through getting what we need on our own, without depending on others, we can stand tall and realize our potential as humans.</p>\n<p>\"The greatest discovery of my generation is the fact that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.\"</p>\n<p>No two people see or experience the world in the same way.</p>\n<p>The world simply exists as it is - things or events are not good or bad, right or wrong, ugly or beautiful.</p>\n<p>We shape much of the reality that we perceive, dictated by our moods and emotions.</p>\n<p>Each of us sees the world through a particular lens that colors and shapes our perceptions.</p>\n<p>When we love or admire someone, we tend to internalize a part of their presence, and they shape how we see the world in a positive way.</p>\n<p>What we must understand about the attitude is not only how it colors our perceptions but also how it actively determines what happens to us in life - our health, our relations with people, and our success.</p>\n<p>you must become aware of your own attitude and how it slants your perceptions.</p>\n<p>you must not only be aware of the role of your attitude, but also believe in its supreme power to alter your circumstances.</p>\n<p>See yourself as an explorer.</p>\n<p>Although adversity and pain are generally beyond your control, you have the power to determine your response and the fate that comes from that.</p>\n<p>You must accept diversity and that fact that people are what they are.</p>\n<p>The soul is not the mind or the body but rather the overall spirit we embody, our way of experiencing the world.</p>\n<p>You accept and embrace uncertainty and the unexpected as valuable qualities of life.</p>\n<h3>Confront Your Dark Side</h3>\n<p>you have crafted a public persona that accentuates your strengths and conceals your weaknesses.</p>\n<p>your task as a student of human nature is to recognize and examine the dark side of your character.</p>\n<p>The Shadow consists of all the qualities people try to deny about themselves and repress.</p>\n<p>The Shadow lies buried deep within, but it becomes disturbed and active in moments of stress, or when deep wounds and insecurities are triggered.</p>\n<p>the only way that something unpleasant or uncomfortable in our unconscious mind is through active denial.</p>\n<p>When people are drunk and behave differently, often it is not the alcohol that is speaking but the Shadow.</p>\n<p>behind any vehement hatred is often a secret and very unpalatable envy of the hated person or people.</p>\n<p>See our Shadow in action and become more self-aware.</p>\n<p>Through such self-knowledge we can find a way to integrate the dark side into our consciousness productively and creatively.</p>\n<p>the emphatic trait generally rests on top of the opposite trait, distracting and concealing it from public view.</p>\n<p>The laws of human nature dictate, the deeper the repression, the greater the volatility of the Shadow.</p>\n<p>We are completely drawn to the authentic types and unconsciously repulsed by their opposite.</p>\n<p>People can often see our Shadow better than we can.</p>\n<p>Your goal - not only complete acceptance of the Shadow but the desire to integrate it into your present personality.</p>\n<p>The conscious thinking, we depend on is quite limited.</p>\n<p>You pay a greater price for being so nice and deferential than for consciously showing your Shadow.</p>\n<p>Trust your native genius and the ideas you have come up with.</p>\n<h3>Beware the Fragile Ego</h3>\n<p>it is socially toxic to display envy.</p>\n<p>envy is a painful emotion, an admission of our own inferiority, something rather unbearable for us humans.</p>\n<p>In order for enviers to feel entitled to take harmful action, they must create a narrative.</p>\n<p>Envy occurs most commonly and painfully among friends.</p>\n<p>people who feel envy in the first place are often motivated to become our friends.</p>\n<p>Any success or increase in attention that we experience will cause greater leakage of their true feeling.</p>\n<p>the pain inflicted by one envier friend can resonate and poison you for years.</p>\n<p>Of all the human emotions, none is trickier or more elusive than envy.</p>\n<p>We almost never directly express the envy we are feeling.</p>\n<p>Your task as a student of human nature is to transform yourself into a master decoder of envy.</p>\n<p>It is a fact of social life that there are always people who are superior to us in wealth, intelligence, likability, and other qualities.</p>\n<p>You can do this in three ways: by learning the signs of envy that manage to leak through, by being aware of the types of people who are more prone to acting on envy, and by understanding the circumstances and actions that might trigger active envy in people.</p>\n<p>People who are envious cannot help feeling some glee when they hear of the bad luck of those they envy.</p>\n<p>envying types secretly loathe those who are immune to feeling envy.</p>\n<p>the power you have to short-circuit envy by placing attention on other people instead of yourself and engaging with them on a meaningful level.</p>\n<p>We all compare ourselves with others; we all feel unsettled by those who are superior in some area that we esteem; and we all react to this by feeling some form of envy.</p>\n<h3>Know You Limits</h3>\n<p>the tendency is to blame others for every failure or setback.</p>\n<p>We humans possess a weakness that is latent in us all and will push us into the delusional process without our ever being aware of the dynamic.</p>\n<p>Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new.</p>\n<p>You are rarely aware of your own grandiosity because by its nature it alters your perception of reality and make it hard to have an accurate assessment of yourself.</p>\n<p>People may claim they are interested in the work itself or in contributing to humanity, but often deep down what is really motivating them is the desire to have attention, to have their high self-opinion confirmed by others who admire them, to feel powerful and inflated.</p>\n<p>it would be best for you to accept your limitations and work with that you have, rather than fantasize about godlike powers you can never attain.</p>\n<p>You are simply one person among many in the world, and not naturally superior to anyone.</p>\n<p>Being realistic and pragmatic is what makes us humans so powerful.</p>\n<p>In becoming more realistic, you are simply becoming more human.</p>\n<p>You must admit to yourself that you do want to feel important and be the center of attention.</p>\n<p>You want to get int the habit of focusing deeply and completely on a single project or problem.</p>\n<p>your goal is to see continual improvement in your skill level, which will certainly come from the depth of your focus.</p>\n<p>Your project begins with an idea, and as you try to hone this idea, you let your imagination take flight, being open to various possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Reconnect to the Masculine or Feminine Within You</h3>\n<p>We are all born as complete beings, with many sides to us.</p>\n<p>We have to play certain roles and live up to certain expectations.</p>\n<p>We conform to the expected roles of our culture and time period.</p>\n<p>When in love, we become prey to emotions we cannot control.</p>\n<p>By relating more to the natural feminine or masculine parts within you, you will unleash energy that has been repressed; your mind will recover its natural fluidity, you will understand and relate better to those of the opposite sex; and by ridding yourself of the defensiveness you have in relation to your gender role, you will feel secure in who you are.</p>\n<p>When men make mistakes, they tend to look outward and find other people or circumstances to blame. For women, it is the opposite; they tend to blame themselves and look inward.</p>\n<p>Weakness comes from the inability to ask questions and to learn.</p>\n<p>We are compelled by nature to want to move closer to what is feminine or masculine, in the form of an attraction to another person. But if we are wise, we realize we are equally compelled to do so inwardly. For centuries men have looked to women as muses’ sources of inspiration. The truth is that the muse, for both genders, lies within.</p>\n<h3>Advance with a Sense of Purpose - The Law of Aimlessness</h3>\n<p>We like to present a front to the world that is consistent and mature, but we know inside that we are subject to many different moods and wear many different faces, depending on circumstances.</p>\n<p>We wander through life, never quite reaching the goals that we feel are so important to us, or realizing our potential.</p>\n<p>\"We have a responsibility to set out to discover what we are made for, to discover our life's work, to discover what we are called to do. And after we discover that, we should set out to do it with all the strength and all of the power that we can muster.\"</p>\n<p>Consider this \"life's work\" something that speaks to you from within - a voice it directs you toward activities and goals that mesh with your nature.</p>\n<p>All of us want to believe that there is some purpose and meaning to our life, that we are connected to something larger than ourselves.</p>\n<p>By our nature we humans crave a sense of direction.</p>\n<p>Each human individual is radically unique. This uniqueness is inscribed in us in three ways - the one-of-a-kind configuration of our DNA, the particular way our brains are wired, and our experiences as we go through life, experiences that are unlike any other's.</p>\n<p>With a sense of purpose, we feel much less insecure and are less prone to depression.</p>\n<p>You are one of a kind. Your combination of skills and experience is not replicable, it represents true freedom and the ultimate power we humans can possess.</p>\n<p>The key to success in any field is first developing skills in various areas, which you can later combine in unique and creative ways.</p>\n<p>You want to embrace negative experiences, limitations, and even pain as the perfect means of building up your skills levels and sharpening your sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>The real purpose comes from within.</p>\n<p>Concentrate on maintaining a high sense of purpose, and the success will flow to you naturally.</p>\n<p>We have a much greater chance of attracting attention by developing a high sense of purpose and creating work that will naturally draw people to it.</p>\n<p>Nothing is more awe-inspiring than the human brain itself - its complexity, its untapped potential.</p>\n<h3>Resist the Downward Pull of the Group - The Law of Conformity</h3>\n<p>When people operate in groups, they do not engage in nuanced thinking and deep analysis.</p>\n<p>Their primary desire is to fit in to the group spirit.</p>\n<p>We would have to admit that the moment we enter our work space or any group, we undergo a change.</p>\n<p>the social force, a type of invisible force field that affects and binds a group of people through shared sensations and creates an intense feeling of connection.</p>\n<p>only the eyes of other people can reassure us that we are real and whole and that we belong.</p>\n<p>Group intelligence a thorough understanding of the effect that groups have on our thinking and emotions; with such awareness, we can resist the downward pull.</p>\n<p>The first and primary effect on you in any group is the desire to fit in and cement your sense of belonging.</p>\n<p>in the group setting, we are always performing.</p>\n<p>The third effect of the group on us - the contagiousness of emotions.</p>\n<p>the fourth effect on us is to make us feel more certain about what we and our colleagues are doing, which makes us all the more prone to taking risks.</p>\n<p>Never relinquish your ability to doubt, reflect, and consider other options - your rationality as an individual is your only protection against the madness that can overcome a group.</p>\n<p>no matter the type of culture, or how disruptive it might have been in its origins, the longer a group exists and the larger it grows, the more conservative it will become.</p>\n<p>any group will reflexively focus on some hated enemy, real or imagined, to help bring the tribe together.</p>\n<p>In a group, we get a narcissistic boost from being around those who share our values.</p>\n<p>You must become a consummate observer of yourself as you interact with groups of any size.</p>\n<p>If you feel strong and confident about what makes you unique - your taste, your values, your own experience - you can more easily resist the group effect.</p>\n<p>by relying upon your work and accomplishments to anchor your self-opinion, you won't be so tied to constantly seeking approval and attention.</p>\n<p>reality group consists of members who feel free to contribute their diverse opinions, whose minds are open, and whose focus is on getting work done and cooperating on a high level.</p>\n<p>We must come to the conclusion that the primary group we belong to is that of the human race.</p>\n<p>the dysfunctional dynamic of the group, which tends to produce incompetent lieutenants and grandiose leaders.</p>\n<p>What creates a functional, healthy dynamic is the ability of the group to maintain a tight relationship to reality.</p>\n<p>Instill a collective sense of purpose - you group has a definite purpose, a positive mission that unites its members.</p>\n<p>Assemble the right team of lieutenants, people who have skills that you lack that are diverse in temperament, background, and ideas.</p>\n<p>Learning from mistakes will make the team that much more confident moving forward.</p>\n<p>by participating in a high-functioning reality group, we can make ourselves healthy and whole.</p>\n<h3>Make Them Want to Follow You - Law of Fickleness</h3>\n<p>people are always ambivalent about those in power.</p>\n<p>Although there are no longer powerful kings and queens in our midst, more of us than ever operate as if we consider ourselves royalty.</p>\n<p>everything we get from others, and most definitely their respect, must be earned.</p>\n<p>We have to show that our primary consideration is not ourselves and our sensitive egos but the welfare of the group.</p>\n<p>We expect the members of the group to follow our lead and prove themselves in return.</p>\n<p>We love certain people and hate others; we respect and admire this individual and have nothing but disdain for another.</p>\n<p>We don't feel comfortable with the inferiority and dependence that comes with serving under a leader.</p>\n<p>When it comes to our primary task - that of providing a vision for the group and leading it toward the appropriate goals - we must be stern and immovable.</p>\n<p>You must make yourself a consummate observer of the phenomenon of authority, using as a measuring device the degree of influence people wield without the use of force or motivational speeches.</p>\n<p>we must recognize the myriad dangers of our prejudice against authority figures.</p>\n<p>We must embrace the risks and dangers that comes with leadership and authority.</p>\n<p>Remember that the essence of authority is that people willingly follow your lead.</p>\n<p>The authority you establish must emerge naturally from your character; from the particular strengths you possess.</p>\n<p>We humans are self-absorbed by nature and spend most of our time focusing inwardly on our emotions, on our wounds, on our fantasies.</p>\n<p>hone your listening skills, absorbing yourself in the words and nonverbal cues of others.</p>\n<p>you dedicate yourself to earning people's respect.</p>\n<p>you consider being a leader a tremendous responsibility.</p>\n<p>you absorb yourself in the work, not your ego.</p>\n<p>Those who maintain their presence of mind and elevate their perspective above the moment tap into the visionary power of the human mind and cultivate that third eye for unseen forces and trends.</p>\n<p>As the leader, you must be seen working as hard as or even harder than everyone else.</p>\n<p>develop the highest possible standards for your own work and by training yourself to be constantly aware of how your manner and tone affect people in the subtlest of ways.</p>\n<p>As the leader, you want to be more mysterious, to establish a presence that fascinates people.</p>\n<p>you must learn to balance presence and absence.</p>\n<p>Silence is a form of absence and withdrawal that draws attention; it spells self-control and power; when you do talk, it has a greater effect.</p>\n<p>you are living off the fruits of millions of people in the past who have made your life incomparably easier through their struggles and inventions.</p>\n<p>You are here not merely to gratify your impulses and consume what others have made but to make and contribute as well, to serve a higher purpose.</p>\n<p>Judge things and people for yourself.</p>\n<p>Embrace what makes you different.</p>\n<h3>See the Hostility Behind the Friendly Facade - the Law of Aggression</h3>\n<p>they get to where they're going primarily through their aggressive energy, not through their particular talents.</p>\n<p>they value amassing power more than the quality of their work.</p>\n<p>They do not like to share power.</p>\n<p>In dealing with this type, you will tend to become angry or fearful, enlarging their presence and playing into their hands.</p>\n<p>Understand their primary motivation - to gain control over the environment and the people around them.</p>\n<p>All of us understand that human have been capable of much violence and aggression in the past and in the present.</p>\n<p>Feeling of love often turn to hostility and aggression in people, because it is in love that we feel most dependent, vulnerable, and helpless.</p>\n<p>We are willful creatures who craves power.</p>\n<p>The desire for power is not evil or antisocial; it is a natural response to the awareness of our essential weakness and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>human aggression stems from an underlying insecurity, as opposed to simply an impulse to hurt or take from others.</p>\n<p>A person who is truly strong from within can endure criticism and open discussion without feeling personally threatened.</p>\n<p>We must also be aware that aggressors see the people around them as object to use.</p>\n<p>you must stop denying the reality of your own aggressive tendencies.</p>\n<p>make yourself a master observer of aggression in the people around you.</p>\n<p>if people know what it is you want and how to get it for you, they have some power over you.</p>\n<p>almost nothing in the world can resist persistent human energy.</p>\n<p>\"I will either find a way, or make a way.\"</p>\n<h3>Seize the Historical Moment - The Law of Generational Myopia</h3>\n<p>There is always discontent below the surface, and hunger for change.</p>\n<p>nothing in human culture stands still.</p>\n<p>what drives these changes is the continual succession of new generations of young people, who are trying to create something more relevant to their experience of the world, something that reflects more their values and spirit and that goes in a different direction from that of the previous generation.</p>\n<p>Generational awareness. To attain it, first we must understand the actual profound effect that our generation has on how we view the world, and second we must understand the larger generational patterns that shape history and recognize where our time period fits into the overall scheme.</p>\n<p>Our generation has inherited from our parents and the past certain key values and ways of looking at the world that remained unquestioned.</p>\n<p>you alter your attitude toward your own generation.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to understand as deeply as possible how profoundly the spirit of your generation, and the times that you live in, have influenced how you perceive the world.</p>\n<p>you are a product of the times as much as anyone; the generation you were born into has shaped your thoughts and values, whether you are aware of this or not.</p>\n<p>You may feel a deep need to create something new and more relevant to your generation, but the past will almost always exercise a strong pull on you, in the form of the values of your parents that you internalized at a young age.</p>\n<p>It is human nature for people to crave more social interaction with whom they feel an affinity.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Robert Greene"],"seo_description":"The laws of human nature by Robert Greene notes.","title":"The Laws Of Human Nature"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/the-laws-of-human-nature/"}}}
