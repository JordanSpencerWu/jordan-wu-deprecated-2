They must accept risk; they must trust the people they work with and strive to clear the path for them; and always, they must pay attention to and engage with anything that creates fear.</p>\n<p>Unhindered communication was key, no matter what your position.</p>\n<p>That to create a fertile laboratory, they had to assemble different kinds of thinkers and then encourage their autonomy.</p>\n<p>When faced with a challenge, get smarter.</p>\n<p>Always take a chance on better, even if it seems threatening.</p>\n<p>You must believe in the future and your ability to shape it.</p>\n<p>For all the care, you put into artistry, visual polish frequently doesn't matter if you are getting the story right.</p>\n<p>Instead of talking about whether it's easier to lower a price than raise it, we should have been addressing more substantive issues such as how to meet the expectations of customers and how to keep investing in software development so that the customers who did buy our product could put it to better use.</p>\n<p>\"just-in-time manufacturing\" or \"total quality control\": The responsibility for finding and fixing problems should be assigned to every employee, from the most senior manager to the lowliest person on the production line.</p>\n<p>The good stuff was hiding the bad stuff.</p>\n<p>\"Story is King\"</p>\n<p>Trust the people. not the process.</p>\n<p>While there are inevitably difficulties and misstep in any complex creative endeavor, you can trust that \"the process\" will carry you through.</p>\n<p>If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.</p>\n<p>Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.</p>\n<p>Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas.</p>\n<p>Find, develop, and support good people, and they in turn will find, develop, and own good ideas.</p>\n<p>\"Quality is the best business plan.\"</p>\n<p>Put smart, passionate people in a room together, charge them with identifying and solving problems, and encourage them to be candid with one another.</p>\n<p>Creativity has to start somewhere, and we are true believers in the power of bracing, candid feedback and the iterative process, reworking, reworking, and reworking again, until a flawed story finds its through line or a hollow character finds its soul.</p>\n<p>\"You can and should make your own solution group. There are the qualifications required: The people you choose must a) make you think smarter and b) put lots of solutions on the table in a short amount of time.\"</p>\n<p>The better, more subtle interpretation is that failure is a manifestation of learning and exploration.</p>\n<p>If we as leaders can talk about our mistakes and our part in them, then we make it safe for others.</p>\n<p>Being open about problems is the first step toward learning from them.</p>\n<p>While we don't want too many failures, we must think of the cost of failure as an investment in the future.</p>\n<p>When experimentation is seen as necessary and productive, not as a frustrating waste of time, people will enjoy their work, even when it is confounding them.</p>\n<p>The more time you spend mapping out an approach, the more likely you are to get attached to it.</p>\n<p>To be a truly creative company, you must start things that might fail.</p>\n<p>One of the most crucial responsibilities of leadership is creating a culture that rewards those who lift not just our stock prices but our aspirations as well.</p>\n<p>Leaders must demonstrate their trustworthiness, over time, through their actions, and the best way to do that is by responding well to failure.</p>\n<p>Be patient. Be authentic. And be consistent. The trust will come.</p>\n<p>The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations.</p>\n<p>There is no growth or success without change.</p>\n<p>Fear of change, innate, stubborn, and resistant to reason, is a powerful force.</p>\n<p>We can store patterns and conclusions in our heads, but we cannot store randomness itself.</p>\n<p>When it comes to creativity, the unknown is not our enemy. If we make room for it instead of shunning it, the unknown can bring inspiration and originality.</p>\n<p>If we allow more people to solve problems without permission, and if we tolerate and don't vilify their mistakes, then we enable a much larger set of problems to be addressed.</p>\n<p>Everyone says they want to hire excellent people, but in truth we don't really know, at first, who will rise up to make a difference. I believe in putting in place a framework for finding potential, then nurturing talent and excellence, believing that many will rise, while knowing that not all will.</p>\n<p>If you don't try and uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.</p>\n<p>We all know that people bring their bets selves to interaction with their bosses and save their lesser moments for their peers, spouses, or therapists.</p>\n<p>Here's what turns a successful hierarchy into one that impedes progress: when too many people begin, subconsciously, to equate their own value and that of others with where they fall in the pecking order.</p>\n<p>\"Hindsight is 20-20\": Accepting that we can look back on what happened, see it with total clarity, learn from it, and draw the right conclusions.</p>\n<p>The past should be our teacher, not our master.</p>\n<p>We aren't aware that the majority of what we think we see is actually our brain filling in the gaps.</p>\n<p>Honor the viewpoints of others!</p>\n<p>Our mental models aren't reality.</p>\n<p>The Hidden and our acknowledgement of it is an absolutely essential part of rooting out what impedes our progress: clinging to what works, fearing change, and deluding ourselves about our roles in our own success.</p>\n<p>Candor, safety, research, self-assessment, and protecting the new are all mechanisms we can use to confront the unknown and to keep the chaos and fear to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Here are several mechanisms used to put the collective heads into a different frame of mind.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dailies, or Solving Problems Together</li>\n<li>Research Trips</li>\n<li>The Power of Limits</li>\n<li>Integrating Technology and Art</li>\n<li>Short Experiments</li>\n<li>Learning to See</li>\n<li>Postmortems</li>\n<li>Continuing to Learn</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\"</p>\n<p>A culture of candor and freedom and the kind of constructive self-criticism that allowed our people, and the movies they made, to evolve into their best selves.</p>\n<p>We will always have problems, many of which are hidden from our view; we must work to uncover them and assess our own role in them, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; when we then come across a problem, we must marshal all our energies to solve it.</p>\n<p>Unleashing creativity requires that we loosen the controls, accept risk, trust our colleagues, work to clear the path for them, and pay attention to anything that creates fear.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Amy Wallace","Edwin Catmull"],"seo_description":"Creativity, Inc. - overcoming the unseen forces that stand in the way of true inspiration by Amy Wallace and Edwin Catmull notes.","title":"Creativity, Inc. - Overcoming The Unseen Forces That Stand In The Way Of True Inspiration"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/creativity-inc/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1584199405","4008572679"]}
