&lt;p&gt;You have a great potential for success, but first you must know your own mind and live your own life - then you will find and enjoy that mighty potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must find out how to live your own life, use your own mind, go on toward the dream you wish to make real and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never believe you don&apos;t have what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you must know your own mind; then you find success consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is nothing beyond the power of a mind that knows itself and believes in its own capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 Close the Doors on Your Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every adversity has within it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you speak of success, you attract success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money brings much good into your life and much that nobody should have to do without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your work and your money benefit someone besides yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not hurt any other person in order that you may succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close the door on your past and keep it closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go the extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the willingness to do more than you absolutely must is the hallmark of the big earner, the great leader, the happy and hearty person who day by day builds value into his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you start never matters so much as where you are going - and it is first within your own mind that you conceive greatly and begin to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3 The Basic Mental Attitude That Brings Wealth and Peace of Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your mental attitude with definiteness of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world makes way for a man who knows where he is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a positive mind automatically obtains benefit from other positive minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear and anger put the mind behind bars. Guilt wraps the mind in chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life reflects your own thoughts back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4 When You Are Free of Fear, You Are Free to Live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free yourself of fear, and you free yourself of a man-made devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seven Fears&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fear of poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fear of criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fear of ill health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of the loss of love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of the loss of liberty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of old age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man was made to live in full possession of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind has limitless power to make a desire come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only fear can rob you of love and liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The years past youth can be the best years of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5 Will You Master Money? Or Will It Master You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that robs you of peace of mind robs you of life&apos;s greatest wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;absolutely nothing is as precious as your peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you can be rich with peace of mind, but if money or anything else gets in the way of your peace of mind, choose peace of mind and let the other go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a mighty teacher in adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money will buy a great deal but it will not buy peace of mind - it only will help you find peace of mind. But neither money nor anything else can help you find peace of mind unless you begin the journey from within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 6 The Blessed Art of Sharing Your Riches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth that is shared creates more wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong connection between the power to make money and the power to know your own mind and fulfill your own self as a fully realized person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth creates wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is something you build for yourself out of service to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has something to share and gains by sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7 How to Develop Your Own Healthy Ego&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the need for knowing your own mind and going in your own direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ego is a strictly personal matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before any salesman sells anything to anyone, he first must sell it to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My ego is under my control and it does my bidding without fear or limitation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know thyself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for your own ego-booster and you will find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 8 How to Transmute Sex Emotion into Achievement Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is within every man&apos;s ability to transmute some of his sex emotion into a dynamic drive which brings success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything you do can be electrifying and positive and profitable when it is infused with sex emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful people tend to be highly sexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is never too late to start living a wonderful new life. The potential always is there, and the means are available to any person who will reach out and take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is good at any age, but the sooner you find it, the longer you will enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women who make a man&apos;s world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Behind every man stands a woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&apos;s greatest drive comes from his desire to please and protect women!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 9 To Succeed in Life, Succeed in Being Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the man who has found his true self can know himself, find his own best talents and achieve his own high success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to live our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;man is truly rich who owns his own mind as well as his own fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being yourself and living our own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-control gives you strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind is your only master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU are bound only by the pattern you set up in your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allot your time in favor of the &quot;musts&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn the great lesson that every day should contain a good amount of time in which you enjoy your own personal pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 10 The Master Mind Group - A Power Beyond Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who has peace of mind always gives as well as receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your own way to get rid of worry - but keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can form your own Master Mind Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind is strengthened by peace and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 11 Win Mighty Aid from the Eternal Law of Compensation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of Compensation can work for you or against you depending upon the way you guide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every act rewards itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a third silent party to all our bargains.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everything you have missed, you have gained something else; and for everything you gain, you lose something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;notice the mistakes other people make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;success lies ahead, life lies ahead, and only takes from the past whatever may have been a valuable lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people learn best from experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your own mind can change your world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimely, nothing matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing matters ultimately, so why fill your life with fear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your cue from nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He must know, with confident self-respect, that his first duty is to improve himself and his condition; and that out of this, when it is well done, flows his second duty, which is to help humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 13 Not Too Much, Not Too Little&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your mind truly perceives your potential for wealth, you take advantage of the wealth-building opportunities all around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace of mind is an essential ingredient of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth comes to the man who can see a potential for wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth ALWAYS begins in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace of mind is wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not limit what you give, limit what you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody who lives only to accumulate money can know happiness, and there is no real success unless one is successful in being happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 14 The Magic Power of Belief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrate on precisely what you want, and you will see signposts that point the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYTHING the human mind can believe, the human mind can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A belief is part of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your subconscious mind is your hidden boss, then, and gives orders to your conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decide upon the belief you want, set it firmly into your subconscious mind, and your subconscious will thereafter instruct your conscious mind to &quot;live up to&quot; that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every man can surpass himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your life depends upon your power to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 15 Enthusiasm - And Something More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm is the great tool of persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm is a state of mind that inspires and arouses one to put ACTION into the task at hand. It is the most contagious of all emotions and transmits the impetus toward agreement and action to all within reach of your words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling and auto-suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not be in the business of selling - but you always sell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm is a vital force that energizes all the forces of your mind and body. Make enthusiasm part of any auto suggestion process; part of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good selling is honest selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No person can afford to express, through thoughts or acts, that which is not in harmony with his own belief, for if he does he must pay by the loss of his ability to influence others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot afford to suggest to another person, by word of mouth or in writing, or through any act, that which you yourself do not believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 16 It Is up to You to Live the Life the Creator Gave You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear has no place in a well-lived life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Creator provided you with control over your own power of thought and made it impossible for any person to rob you of this privilege - unless you let him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your greatness is here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your happiness is here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good thing in the world that is not available to you if you sufficiently desire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You yourself are the only one who can hold and enjoy your greatest treasure, peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherish your visions and your dreams. They are the children of your soul, the blueprints of your ultimate achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make your life what you want it to be - but it must be your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look to the past only for what it taught you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are free of fear, you are free to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three basic motives of love, sex, and money are said to rule the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to live your life exactly as you wish to live it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not limit what you give, only what you take.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rational Male]]></title><description><![CDATA[Being educated, on a great many subjects, and learning how to learn, is its own reward.

&lt;p&gt;ONEitis: An unhealthy romantic obsession with a single person. Usually accompanied by unreciprocated affection and completely unrealistic idealization of said person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ONE. This is the soul-mate myth. There are some good Ones and some bad Ones, but there is no ONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more ONEs out there that could meet or exceed the criteria we subconsciously set for them to be the ONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of Power is not financial success, status, or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control in a healthy relationship passes back and forth as desire and need dictate for each partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a better sense of self-worth and a better understanding of your true efficacy in your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compromise is always going to be a part of any relationship, but what&apos;s key is realizing when that compromise becomes the result of manipulation, what is in effect and developing the confidence to be uncompromising in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No woman&apos;s intimacy i.e. sex is ever worth that compromise because in doing so you devalue your own worth to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightened self-interest: There is no more a superior confidence for a man than one with the self-understanding that he will not compromise himself for the recognized manipulations of a woman, and the fortitude to walk away knowing he has in the past, and will in the future find a better prospect than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Power is the degree to which we actually control the direction of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be unafraid to make ourselves the prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot negotiate genuine Desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine desire in something a person must come to, or be led to, of their own volition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to be with a woman who wants to please you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real desire is created by her thinking it&apos;s something she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women never want full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity is anti-seductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women don&apos;t want to be comfortable with a potential or proven sex partner, they need their imaginations stroked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with a potential partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date non-exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember, perfect is boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivate an element of unpredictability about yourself prior to and into a long term relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection is better than Regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha behaviors are manifestations of an Alpha mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every guy has a Game. Everyone thinks they are Alpha in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal should be to attract women effortlessly, so play to your strengths no matter what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha = Leader of Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man is confident and valuable as his options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will manifest itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who maintains social proof that other women will compete for him, maintains power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinning more plates allows you more opportunity to select from the largest pool of prospective choices and date them or drop them as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience teaches harshly, but it teaches best and the breadth of experience serves a man well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity and options make a man the prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled with a faithful loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinning Plates doesn&apos;t necessarily mean you&apos;re having sex with all of your plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internalize an abundance mentality and be non-exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-exclusivity has to be covert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagination and competition anxiety paired with implied non-exclusivity are the cornerstones of successful plate spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monogamy is a by-product, not a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only chase what runs away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women communicate covertly, with gestures, with looks, with veiled meanings - you have to communicate your intent to be non-exclusive covertly. Never overtly tell a woman you&apos;ve got other plates than her spinning. Allow her to discover this by your mannerisms, your behaviors, definitely by your availability to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create value through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence is derived from options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not a numbers game, it&apos;s a non-exclusivity game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You make the perfect woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is to mold yourself and any woman who you do exclusively end up with into your own frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot help anyone until you&apos;ve first helped yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest obstacles most men have with accepting the fundamentals of a positive masculine mindset is the attitude that personality is static and uncontrollable by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is you who determine what is comfortable for you and what will constitute the trait that makes your personality your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any reasonably attractive women knows you&apos;d like to have sex with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As men, our biological impetus is a desire for unlimited access to unlimited sexuality with females bearing the best physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivate an attitude of being the prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truly powerful Man&apos;s most precious resource is his options and his ability to exercise them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control the course of your own life and your own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women should only ever be a compliment to a man&apos;s life, never the focus of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be the object of women&apos;s pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman&apos;s first priority is to seek out security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is socially acceptable for a woman to blatantly spin plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman can always change her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All woman are sexual, you just need to be the right guy at the right time for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By practicing honest, non-exclusive dating you communicate to your prospective plates that you are in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing serves a man better than having 3 or 4 women competing for his exclusive attention and fostering in them that feminine competitive anxiety in as subtle and covert a way as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shit-test is used by women to determining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundance thinking is the root of Plate Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only time a man should even contemplate monogamy is after experiencing abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You create value by scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarcity increases value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine what a quality woman means to you and how to recognize her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a committed relationship, you simply cannot spin plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man&apos;s default response should always be to excuse him from the let&apos;s just be friends situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such thing as a long distance relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because her intimacy with him is genuine, unnegotiated, unobligated desire. She wants to have sex with him, she doesn&apos;t owe him sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very nature of an intergender friendship is always going to be limited by sexual differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covertly communicate to a woman that your goals and determination trump her one real power over you - her sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man you wish to become requires you to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must kill the Beta you, to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer you remain uncommitted, the more opportunities will be available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman want a Man who other men want to be, and other women want to fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t consider monogamy until you are mature enough to understand its limiting effects and you&apos;ve achieved a degree of success to your own satisfaction according to your ambitions and passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to have A Look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth will set you free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplugging is accepting the hard truths that Game and a new awareness of gender relations forces upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only Game and the degree to which you accept it and are comfortable in using it in the context that you define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her uncommited sex life it was a tool for qualification, in her long term relationship life it&apos;s a tool for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminine Imperative wants Vagina = Authority and do what she says = get sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed is incremental reassertion of yourself as the primary AND that her sexual agency, while still welcomed, is not a motivator for your own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women want to be with Men who other woman want to fuck, and other men want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagina is Not Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you make yourself, the more authority you command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is as simultaneously fear inspiring and arousing for women as a Man she suspects is self-aware of his own value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are who you believe you are, and you are who she perceives you to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person can improve themselves by changing their outlook and modifying their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to improve yourself to get the things you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort and trust are post-orgasm conditions; anxiety, arousal, and sexual urgency are pre-orgasm conditions - and both have their own unique hormonal signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women with a high interest level won&apos;t confuse you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women tell the complete truth with their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only way to determine genuine motivation and/or intent is to observe the behavior of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men convey information, women convey feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants you to &apos;get it&apos; on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants a Man who knows he needs to be dominant with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicate with your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women NEVER want full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment to uniquely reflect feminine interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment should be a function of genuine desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have one life to live and one precious lifetime to do it in, it&apos;s a commitment to oneself in learning and securing the best options for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are the disposable sex, women, the preserved sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women want the freedom to pursue a short term sexual opportunity and also the prudence to filters for man willing to assume the respnsibilities of parental investment and provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypergamy is a woman&apos;s natural preference for a higher status male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women naturally prefer the highest status man they can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When women are pursuing short and medium term mating they always prefer the most socially dominant male they can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about regret is, it&apos;s better to regret something you have done, than regret something you haven&apos;t done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is supposed to make you uncomfortable in order to inspire you to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept the game for what it is, understand it and master it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t wish things were easier, wish you were better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concept of frame is whose reality in which you choose to operate in relation to a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are either operating in your own frame or you&apos;re operating in hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital to the health of any long term relationship that a man establishes his frame as the basis of their living together before any formal commitment is recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman resorts to overt communication she&apos;s generally exhausted her patience to be covert and this is a desperation tactic for an insecure woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman intentionally makes you wait for sex you are not her highest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexuality is a spontaneous chemical reaction between two parties, not a process of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman who wants to fuck you will find a way to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine desire cannot be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex that is motivated by mutual, genuine desire is a tense affair, fueled by testosterone, anxiety, and urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alpha wouldn&apos;t wait for sex and she know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember why women resort to overt communications - so there is no, or less, margin that her message will be misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never under any circumstance live with a woman you aren&apos;t married to or are not planning to marry within 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never allow a woman to be in control of the birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your self-doubt about your worthiness of a woman&apos;s intimacy stems from the preconditioned idea that you&apos;re out of her league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you can&apos;t, you&apos;re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men have their own rating systems by physical beauty on a scale of 1 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disregard for the influence of the feminine imperative that makes the Alpha attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never self-deprecate under any circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never admit a lack of confidence in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women want a competent, confident, decisive Man from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real test for a man is how he lives with himself, alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who is comfortable with himself and confident in his true independence is the one that women will want to be associated with and to share in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game and a positive - masculine mindset are vital elements for your attractiveness and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women don&apos;t want a Man to cheat, but they love a Man who could cheat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Man's Guide To Woman]]></title><description><![CDATA[Women are mysterious.

&lt;p&gt;Men have the power to make or break a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is what you do and the way you think that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All women are unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one thing that women look for is trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustworthiness is this: You are who you say you are and you do what you say you are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be there for them emotionally: listening to them, caring for them, and safeguarding their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attunement is when men &quot;attune&quot; to their women, there is less fighting; more frequent and better sex, and both men and women no longer feel so alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trait women want most: trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is built through: emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional connection is created through: attunement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just A-TT-U-N-E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATTEND&lt;/strong&gt;: Give your undivided attention when it&apos;s needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TURN TOWARD&lt;/strong&gt;: Physically. Turn. Toward. Your. Partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNDERSTAND&lt;/strong&gt;: No matter what she is saying, the goal is understanding. And how you get to understanding is by asking questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NON-DEFENSIVELY LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt;: Don&apos;t react. Her feelings are real to her at that moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMPATHIZE&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to feel how a woman is feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being genuinely interested in her is much more important than trying to be interesting to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a relationship with a woman to last, she needs to know who you are, and she needs to feel safe with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For women, being sexual is equivalent to being vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men want less fighting and more sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are not a problem for girls. They are a good thing, an opportunity for intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a woman there are no negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are opportunities for intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy trinity for female hormones - estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone determines a woman&apos;s day to day reality; what she values; how outgoing or active she is; what her needs are; and what, when, and even who she desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her moods generally have nothing to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women experience fear in a very different way than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman is afraid, hold her hand and try to help her avoid feeling afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are attracted to men who are the CEO and president of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who ultimately controls whether or not a man approaches her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nonverbal cues that let a woman know you are high status, a protector, a provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she wants you, she will put a bid in your direction. The most common bid is direct eye contact. A smile. Repeatedly glancing at you and away from you. These are the signals; what you do with them is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual attraction is the only attraction worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of dating is to find someone genuinely interested in you for who you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you create safety in a conversation is by being a good listener and being genuinely interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation is an art, and it&apos;s an art that puts the other person at center stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower pitched voices in men are considered more attractive to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask for her phone number or ask her out on a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating is about putting her front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating is also about containing the conversation and getting to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pheromones are going to make a woman feel an attraction to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s sense of smell is stronger than a man&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your smell matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman always, always remembers the first kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&apos;t change. At their core, who they are and how they treat others will not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you trust her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great relationship is a mix of heart, mind, and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose your partner carefully. Your relationship will cause you 90 percent of the joy or sorrow in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does she make you feel when you are with her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your body, mind, and heart are all in alignment with hers, then there&apos;s a very good change she&apos;s more than a hookup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men crave a woman&apos;s body and never get tired of looking at a woman&apos;s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are beautiful no matter what you wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman doesn&apos;t see herself separately from her body, and therefore she often defines her worth in terms of her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s self-esteem is heavily dependent on her own appraisal of her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men can make or break any relationship, and they can also make or break any relationship a woman has with her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s desire is dependent on her feeling desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovemaking begins with your words, your smiles, and your gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest sex organ a woman has is her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly know a woman&apos;s body you have to first know her mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She needs to feel emotionally and physically safe with you before she can feel completely sexually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man every woman wants has a healthy relationship with and respect for the cliteris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly make love to a woman you have to make love to her whole body with your mind, your eyes, your words, your heart, and your touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly be the hero in a woman&apos;s life, you have to be a hero both in and out of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman need to feel emotionally connected to have sex, and men need to have sex to feel emotionally connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual desire for sex is to connect the mind, the heart, and the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best things about sex: What&apos;s good for her is good for you, and what&apos;s good for you is good for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman bares her neck it&apos;s a major sign of interest, and that is the time for you to appreciate the neck that she has entrusted to your lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man&apos;s single greatest tool in his quest to pleasure and satisfy his partner is oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best predictor on whether a marriage would last was a woman&apos;s clothes consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve entered into a serious relationship with a woman, the truth is, you&apos;ve also entered into a relationship with her friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men need a woman to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determined whether men would die younger was whether or not they were married, whereas for women it was their friendships with other women that determined their longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of your friendship is important to your relationship, but the quality of her friendships with other women is also important to your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage one is about seeking chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage two is about building trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage three is about building loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man becomes his best self when he has a real partner in life at his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman is the right woman for you, you feel comfortable and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men who are socially isolated die young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distrust and betrayal are at the heart of every failed relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero = turns toward his partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero = turns away from his partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Affair-Proofing Your Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 second kiss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date her&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to know her&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciate her&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honor her dreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What men most want to know about women is how to love them and how to get their love in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are at your best when you are in a loving, exciting, and life-changing relationship with a woman.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Compound Effect - Jumpstart Your Income, Your Life, Your Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[You reap what you sow; you can't get out of life what you're not willing to put into it.

&lt;p&gt;When you study and master the science of achievement, you will find the success you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your own decisions shape your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is simple. Do the right things and keep doing them day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know what you need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need new information. You need a new plan of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow and steady wins the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll win because of the positive habits I&apos;ve developed, along with the consistency I use in applying those habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No excuses. If you aren&apos;t good at something, work harder, work smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profound success was the result of small, smart choices, completed consistently over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to success is hard work, discipline, and good habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only path to success is through a continuum of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and somtimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life we end up with is simply an accumulation of all the choices we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in your life exists because you first made a choice about something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choices are at the root of every one of your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each choice starts a behavior that over time becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, you make your choices and then your choices make you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when you&apos;re willing to take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work will it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You alone are responsible for what you do or don&apos;t do, or how you respond to what&apos;s done to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Complete Formula For Getting Lucky - Preparation + Attitude + Opportunity + Action = Luck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step toward change is awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track every action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get results you have to take some action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All winners are trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your life is the product of your moment to moment choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are what we repeatedly do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit: An acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You MUST know your why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the reason is big enough, you will be willing to perform almost any how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success without fulfillment is failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core values define both who you are and what you stand for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus your creative power on a well-defined target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest achievers in the world have all succeeded because they mapped out their visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are goal-seeking creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you instruct your brain to look for the things you want, you will begin to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you define your goals, you gave your brain something new to look for and focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and why know what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do I need to become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stands between you and your goal is your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You -&gt; Choice + Behavior + Habit + Compounded = Goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You habits are learned and they can be unlearned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Yourself Up to Succeed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think Addition, Not Subtraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for a PDA: Public Display of Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a Success Buddy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition &amp;#x26; Camaraderie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra-ordinary is what will separate you from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Build Up momentum By&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making new choices based on your goals and core values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting those choices to work through new positive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeating those healthy actions long enough to establish new habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building routines and rhythms into your daily disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying consistent over a long enough period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A routine is something you do every day without fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separate the most successful among us from everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is the key to achieving and maintaining momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You alone are responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a peak performance partner, someone equally committed to study and personal growth as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritance you can give to others. And it should never end. It is why you get up every day. To teach and be taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never ask advice from someone with whom you wouldn&apos;t want to trade places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get in life what you tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t wish it were easier; wish you were better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go above and beyond when you hit the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do more than expected in every aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attached.

&lt;p&gt;Adult attachment designates &quot;attachment styles,&quot; or manner in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve been programmed by evolution to single out a few specific individuals in our lives and make them precious to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve been bred to be dependent on a significant other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attachment system consists of emotions and behaviors that ensure that we remain safe and protected by staying close to our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dependency paradox&quot;: The more effectively dependent people are on one another, the more independent and daring they become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your happiness is something that should come from within and should not be dependent on your lover or mate. Your well-being is not their responsibility, and their is not yours. Each person needs to look after himself or herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a &quot;greater sense of self.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two people form an intimate relationship, they regulate each other&apos;s psychological and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong survival advantage is a human couple becoming one physiological unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to take the road to independence and happiness, find the right person to depend on and travel down it with that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure base is the knowledge that you are backed by someone who is supportive and whom you can rely on with 100 percent certainty and turn to in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we feel secure. We can take risks, be creative, and pursue our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our partners are thoroughly dependable and make us feel safe, and especially if they know how to reassure us during the hard times, we can turn our attention to all the other aspects of life that make our existence meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our partner is unable to meet our basic attachment needs, we experience a chronic sense of disquiet and tension that leaves us more exposed to various ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a partner who fulfill our intrinsic attachment needs and feels comfortable acting as a secure base and safe haven can help us remain emotionally and physically healthier and live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating Strategies are thoughts and feelings that compel you to seek closeness with your partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protest behavior is any action that tries to reestablish contact with your partner and get their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True love means peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundance philosophy - understanding that there are many unique and wonderful individuals out there who may be superb partners for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiences are only meaningful when shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deactivating strategy is any behavior or thought that is used to squelch intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re secure, you&apos;re very reliable, consistent, and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best predictor of happiness in a relationship is a secure attachment style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re with someone secure, they nurture you into a more secure stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure attachment styles are characterized by something very real but not outwardly visible - they are programmed to expect their partners to be loving and responsive and don&apos;t worry much about losing their partner&apos;s love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attachment styles are a function of life experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attachment insecurities are partially explained by particular genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a secure person you believe that there are many potential partners open to intimacy and closeness who would be responsive to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure people are less likely to play games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication - surface their feelings and see how their date reacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working model is a phrase that describes our basic belief system when it comes to romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of Secure Principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t interfere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act encouragingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t play games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View yourself as responsible for your partner&apos;s well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear your heart on your sleeve - be courageous and honest in your interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain focus on the problem at hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t make generalizations during conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Douse the flame before it becomes a forest fire - attend to your partner&apos;s upset before they escalate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication is expressing your needs and expectations to your partner in a direct, non accusatory manner is an incredibly powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication works on the understanding that we all have specific needs in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be happy in a relationship, we need to find a way to communicate our attachment needs clearly without resorting to attacks or defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication helps you choose the right partner and to make sure your needs are met in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can judge immediately how important your well-being is to your partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your partner is responsive and genuinely concerned about your happiness and security, you have a green light to go ahead with the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure people believe that they are worthy of love and affection, and expect their partner to be responsive and caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always use effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Principle of Effective Communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear your heart on your sleeve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on your needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be specific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t blame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be assertive and non apologetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Secure Principles for Resolving Conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show basic concern for the other person&apos;s well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain focus on the problem at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refrain from generalizing the conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to engage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate feelings and needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our happiness is actually dependent on our mate&apos;s and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s always more effective to assume the best in conflict situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insecure Conflict Strategies to Avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting sidetracked from the real problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neglecting to effectively communicate your feelings and needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverting to personal attacks and destructiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reacting &quot;tit for tat&quot; to a partner&apos;s negativity with more negativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgetting to focus on the other&apos;s well-being.&lt;/li&gt;

The rich have money work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #1: The Rich Don&apos;t Work For Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;avoid the trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money is an illusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned to make money work for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #2: Why teach financial literacy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence solves problems and produces money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not how much money you make. It&apos;s how much money you keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich people acquire assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be rich, you&apos;ve got to read and understand numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from my asset column compared with the expense column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #3: Mind Your Own Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people work for everyone but themselves. They work first for the owners of the company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is: Mind your own business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #4: The History Of Taxes And The Power Of Corporations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work for money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;financial knowledge is made up of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #5: The Rich Invest Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invest in your financial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson #6: Work To Learn - Don&apos;t Work For Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main management skills needed for success are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give, and you shall receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning means being unafraid to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texans don&apos;t bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take their failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans to become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. It is the formula for all winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they&apos;re not afraid of losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning means being unafraid to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A savvy investor knows that the seemingly worst of times is actually the best of times to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know makes me money. What I don&apos;t know loses me money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make daily choices: the power of choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose friends carefully: the power of association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose heros: the power of myth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving&lt;/li&gt;

Play Bigger, and Multiply Your Impact]]></title><description><![CDATA[most people want a good job, but they also want to make a meaningful contribution; they want their work to matter and to make a difference…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/impact-players/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/impact-players/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;most people want a good job, but they also want to make a meaningful contribution; they want their work to matter and to make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a leader&apos;s behavior can either increase or diminish someone&apos;s ability to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to contribute in meaningful ways and make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players: players who make a significant contribution individually but who also have an enormously positive effect on the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everyday Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messy Problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclear Roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unforeseen Obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving Targets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrelenting Demands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players see everyday challenges through an opportunity lens while others view the same challenges through a threat lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the Job That&apos;s Needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step Up, Step Back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish Stronger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask and Adjust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Work Light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value decoys - professional habits or beliefs that seem useful and appear appreciated but erode more value then they create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players target their efforts where the greatest number of people benefit, they increase their impact and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do the job that was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look beyond our ideal job and do the job that needs to be done, we make ourselves useful and much more valuable and increase our influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors see themselves as position holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players see themselves as problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most influential professionals are first thinkers and then doers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By paying attention to what is valued, they learn how to add value. By adding value, they increase their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players learn what their leaders need and are great practitioners of what I call upward empathy - the tendency to look up at managers and see not only a demanding boss but that boss&apos;s challenges, constraints, and best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real agenda is what&apos;s important right now, and it defines what is relevant and essential for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you aren&apos;t working on your boss&apos;s top three priorities, you are not working on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When there are unclear roles, you have a choice to make. My choice is to lead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take on more responsibility you make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players has stewardship mentality a hearfelt desire to make things better both for themselves and for others and a willingness to take responsibility for making things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can improve this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never ask anyone&apos;s permission to lead. Just lead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is through real human connections that we earn permission to lead our teams, achieve our goals, and elevate our teammates and ourselves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Impact Habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enroll Others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step Back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most influential professionals make a greater impact because they finish the job and finish stronger than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players ensure the job gets done in full, despite unforeseen obstacles and hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players take ownership, anticipate and wrestle down problems, and do what it takes to complete the whole job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Performance Guarantee - Others can count on Impact Players to:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take ownership and get the job done without being reminded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act with integrity and do the right thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be easy to work with, likable, approachable, and positive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply their strengths to the work at hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players view changing conditions and moving targets as opportunities to learn, adapt, and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Players were able to adapt because they were confient in their ability to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have value that can grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;growth mindset - ability can be developed through effort and good teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;confidence enable us to change and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;humility and a willingness to learn increase our credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we admit mistakes early and fix them quickly, we let people know we&apos;re learning and that their feedback was a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;benefit mindset - an extension of a growth mindset in which we not only seek to grow and fulfill our potential but do it in a way that serves the well-being of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can improve well-being for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my efforts can make work better for everyone on my team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Impact Habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Low Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighten the Load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighten the Atmosphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;always being ready to step up or step in increases the value of our contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gratitude is contagious: when we express gratitude in the workplace, we can create a ripple effect that drives the organizational culture toward positivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;behavior is predicated on belief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Skill 1: Changing Your Perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase our impact we must know what is valuable to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we change our perspective, we can increase our impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Skill 2: Changing Your Lens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity lens we take a broader view, seeing options and reasons to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find something that needs to be done and do it without seeking credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t settle for just having a job; strive to do work that makes a meaningful impact in whatever position you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recruit talent with the right mindset, people who were competitive, curious, and coachable. &quot;three C&apos;s&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a space where co-workers could learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dream team isn&apos;t just a dream; it results from carefully curating players with the right mindset, developing them as individuals and as a team, and nurturing a robust, healthy culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&apos;s the leader&apos;s job to grow the talent they already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If leaders want to unleash individual and collective talent, they must foster a psychologically safe climate where employees feel free to contribute ideas, share information, and report mistakes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only do leaders need to build psychological safety; they must set high standards and inspire and enable people to reach them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an environment of both safety and stretch in which individuals feel safe to experiment and fail, yet challenged to perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five High Impact Coaching Habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the W.I.N - What&apos;s Important Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redefine leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them to stay until the job is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critique the work not the person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State what you appreciate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;share agenda, spot opportunities, define the W.I.N, give feedback, invite others in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to foster a culture where everyone contributes at their fullest, look behind the scences and seek out the unsung heros.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No title]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mission Statement: My mission is to live a life I will remember.

&lt;p&gt;Duophonic synthesizers are far less than polyphonic synthesizers restricted to playing two notes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duo-timbrality means that you can create two independent sounds, each with its own oscillators, filter settings, amplifier settings, and contours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duophonic synthesizers are far less than polyphonic synthesizers restricted to playing two notes at a time, but duo-timbral synthesizers are far more than monophonic synthesizers that can play two notes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we&apos;re going to get the best from our synthesizers, we need to understand how their sounds react when played — whatever means we use to play them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Types of priority&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lowest-note priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highest-note priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last-note priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first-note priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on to a lower note for too long on a lowest-note-priority monosynth, and the following higher note will speak too late, making your playing sound uneven and off the beat. The same is true if you hang on to a higher note too long on a highest-note-priority monosynth, and then follow it with a lower note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on to a lower note too long on a highest-note-priority monosynth, and the following higher note will still speak on time, so you&apos;ll get away with your bad technique. The same is true if you hang on to a higher note too long on a lowest-note-priority monosynth, and follow it with a lower note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing Polyphony]]></title><description><![CDATA["Just like human beings, sounds are born, reach their prime, and die; but the life of a sound, from creation to evanescence, lasts only a…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-20/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-20/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just like human beings, sounds are born, reach their prime, and die; but the life of a sound, from creation to evanescence, lasts only a few seconds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just because an electronic instrument can play many pitches simultaneously, it isn&apos;t necessarily truly polyphonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attributes for simpler timbres:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal waveform, which provides both the initial tone and the pitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the changes in brightness and loudness as the note progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;monophonic synthesizer has an oscillator that creates the basic waveform, a filter that controls the tone, and an amplifier that controls the loudness. A contour generator determines how the filter and amplifier modify the sound as it develops over time, and the modulator adds vibrato, tremolo and/or growl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To imitate a moderately complex monophonic sound, or even create a new &apos;electronic&apos; timbre, you need a minimum complement of an oscillator, a filter, an amplifier, a contour generator and a modulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like human beings, sounds are born, reach their prime, and die. Furthermore, if you have more than one person in a room, each must be born, reach his/her prime, and die independently of all the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Polyphony To Digital Synths]]></title><description><![CDATA[If a polyphonic synth allocates a limited number of voices to the notes as you play, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-21/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-21/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If a polyphonic synth allocates a limited number of voices to the notes as you play, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Likewise, if a polyphonic synth has switches that select between preset patches, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Similarly, if a polyphonic synth has user-programmable memories, it too contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Therefore, a totally analogue polysynth can only be one that offers total polyphony provided by independent articulators for each note, and which has no presets and no memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mainstream synthesis, there have only ever been two totally analogue polysynths: the Korg PS3100 and PS3300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you place a reverberator at the end of the chain, your note is extended, with added &apos;ambience&apos; — the perception that the note is produced in a room or hall of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays occur when sound reflects off solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Three distinct temporal parts of reverberation:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&apos;early reflections&apos;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &apos;reverb&apos; portion of the reverbed click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the human brain is not usually capable of perceiving echoes separated by less than 30 milliseconds as distinct sounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;natural reverberation dies away to silence, and we use a measure called the &apos;Reverberation Time&apos; to quantify the rate at which it does so.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Formant Synthesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[the human vocal system comprises a pitch-controlled oscillator, a noise generator, and a set of band-pass filters!

&lt;p&gt;we cannot sample the voltage of the incoming signal with infinite resolution — there is a limit to the number of ways in which we can chop up the amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second limitation in analogue-to-digital conversion concerns the sampling frequency of the system: just as we can not digitise the amplitude with infinite precision, we can not conduct the measurements with infinite speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a signal has a bandwidth of less than F the Nyquist frequency, then 2F samples per second are sufficient to represent that signal fully and unambiguously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analogue signal can be reconstructed, without error, from samples taken at equal time intervals, provided that the sampling rate is greater than twice the highest-frequency component in the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;aliasing&apos; any frequencies above the Nyquist frequency &apos;fold over&apos; and appear an equal distance below the Nyquist frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: if the sampling rate is greater than twice the highest-frequency component in the original signal, it is sufficient to represent that signal fully and unambiguously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Sample & Hold To Sample-rate Converters (1)]]></title><description><![CDATA[a Clock Generator provides an evenly spaced stream of 'ticks' in the form of short pulses.

&lt;p&gt;The first involves directing the S&amp;#x26;H output to an oscillator&apos;s CV input so that it makes the pitch vary randomly. Far less obvious and therefore more interesting than cyclic LFO modulation, it&apos;s the key to humanising many digital sounds, and it&apos;s absolutely vital to any impersonations of real instruments that waver slightly as the note plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example requires you to direct the S&amp;#x26;H output to the CV input of a low-pass filter. This affects the high-frequency content of the sound and, therefore, each clock pulse changes the timbre of the audio passing through the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;analogue sequencer allows you to decide the value of its output CV at every clock step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage Quantiser, or simply a &apos;quantiser&apos; — a device that rounds every voltage passing through it up or down to that which produces an exact semitone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first harmonic, the fundamental is the pitch that you&apos;ll perceive when you listen to the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any given moment the number of harmonics present determines the waveform of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;harmonics and the waveforms are just two ways of expressing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the natures of musical tones are defined by the numbers and amplitudes of the harmonics contained within them, and any given set of harmonics gives us a given waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sawtooth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every harmonic is present, and the amplitude of the nth harmonic is 1/n times that of the fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Modulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[modulation, the trick that makes sounds live and breathe in an organic sort of way. whereas vibrato is a periodic change in the pitch of a…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-10/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-10/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;modulation, the trick that makes sounds live and breathe in an organic sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whereas vibrato is a periodic change in the pitch of a sound, tremolo is a periodic change in the loudness of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will sometimes see references to duty cycles greater than 50 percent. In essence, for any number X lying between zero and 50, a duty cycle of (50+X) percent is identical to that of (50-X) percent, but the phase is inverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pulse wave has the same harmonic distribution as a sawtooth wave except that, for a duty cycle of 1:n where n is an integer every nth harmonic is missing from the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s common to use low-frequency oscillators as the source of the modulating control voltages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amplitude Modulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[When the modulation source is an audio-frequency oscillator and the destination is the Gain of a VCA in the audio signal path, we call the…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-11/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-11/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the modulation source is an audio-frequency oscillator and the destination is the Gain of a VCA in the audio signal path, we call the result Amplitude Modulation, or AM for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two cases of Amplitude Modulation: one where the Modulator lies at a fixed frequency, and another where the Modulator as well as the Carrier tracks the keyboard, or any other controlling voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fixed-Modulator AM is most useful for creating aggressive and conventionally &apos;unmusical&apos; sounds that change dramatically as you play up and down the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplitude Modulation tracking the keyboard, offers a way to create complex non-harmonic timbres that change pitch normally as you play up and down the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplitude Modulation is a powerful tool that allows you to create and play new sounds that you cannot obtain using conventional oscillators alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplitude Modulation which is tremolo at audio frequencies and Filter Modulation which is growl at audio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[More On Frequency Modulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Negative frequencies are the same as positive frequencies, but with their phases inverted. for total cancellation to occur, the amplitudes…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-13/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-13/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Negative frequencies are the same as positive frequencies, but with their phases inverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for total cancellation to occur, the amplitudes of the cancelling components must be equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the concept of an operator — a combination of an oscillator plus any associated envelope generators, mixers and VCAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM it produces sounds that conventional forms of subtractive synthesis cannot, filling holes in your sonic armoury that you never knew you had.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Introduction To Frequency Modulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Chowning found that when the frequency of the modulating signal increased beyond a certain point, the vibrato effect disappeared from the…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-12/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-12/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chowning found that when the frequency of the modulating signal increased beyond a certain point, the vibrato effect disappeared from the modulated tone, and a complex new tone replaced the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Chowning discovered that FM, like AM, generates side bands — additional components, not necessarily harmonically related to the frequency of the Carrier or Modulator — in the frequency spectrum of the output signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sound we hear is not only determined by the frequency of the Modulator, but also by its gain or maximum amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;natural sounds, where increased loudness almost always goes hand-in-hand with increased brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M, we can say the following two things about the relationship between the Modulator and the output signal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of significant spectral components and their amplitudes are determined by the Modulation Index, which is proportional to the Modulator&apos;s amplitude; but inversely proportional to the Modulator&apos;s frequency...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any given Carrier frequency, the position of the spectral components is determined by the Modulator&apos;s frequency alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency Modulation is a powerful method of synthesis that is as relevant to analogue synthesizers as it is to digital ones, and which is capable of generating sounds unobtainable by any other method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Introduction To ESPs & Vocoders]]></title><description><![CDATA[all synthesizers shared one trait: the initial sound has been generated within the synthesizer. whatever the nature of the external signal…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-15/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-15/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;all synthesizers shared one trait: the initial sound has been generated within the synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whatever the nature of the external signal, you can use the Minimoog&apos;s filter to create new timbres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pitch-to-voltage converter, or pitch/CV converter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slew Generator, they slow down transitions from one voltage to another, thus &apos;slewing&apos; any abrupt changes over a period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will most commonly encounter a slew generator in its role as a &apos;portamento&apos; circuit, smoothing the transition from one keyboard-generated pitch CV to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envelope Follower strictly speaking, a &apos;peak amplitude follower&apos; — a circuit that measures the amplitude of the positive peaks of the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the external signal has a very limited ability to modify the timbre of the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your synthesizer has an external signal input plus an envelope follower and a pitch/CV converter, it is a much more powerful and flexible instrument than it would otherwise be. You should experiment with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Introduction To Additive Synthesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[you could represent any waveform as a set of sine waves.

This method of generating a complex sound is often called Fourier synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourier analysis — the mathematical method used to break sounds down into sine waves — and Fourier synthesis — building them back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because, at any given moment, you can describe any waveform in terms of the frequencies and amplitudes of its components, you can take the appropriate number of sine waves and mix them together at the appropriate frequencies and in the appropriate quantities to regenerate the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how clever the method of synthesis, and no matter how complex an initial waveform may be, any timbre will sound static and &apos;organ-like&apos; if it does not change in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we know that the sound becomes duller as time passes, so the higher-frequency harmonics must decay more rapidly than the lower ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we must determine how the overall brightness and loudness of the sound changes as the note progresses, and create filter and amplifier profiles that emulate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a true additive synthesizer will allow you to manipulate individually the amplitudes of 32, 64, 128, or even 256 harmonics, and that&apos;s something that no pre-patched analogue synthesizer can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many of your synthesized sounds will remain unconvincing if they lack a little noise within them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Further With Filters]]></title><description><![CDATA[Filter has the abilities to remove parts of the audio spectrum and create new tones from old. for every doubling of the frequency above the…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-5/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-5/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Filter has the abilities to remove parts of the audio spectrum and create new tones from old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for every doubling of the frequency above the cutoff frequency, the gain at the output is halved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since each doubling of the frequency is equivalent to moving up an octave, and each successive halving of the gain is known as an attenuation of 6dB, this response is most commonly called a 6dB/octave filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cutoff frequency of a passive low-pass filter does not define the frequency at which the filter starts to work; it is itself defined as that frequency at which the signal is already attenuated by 3dB. And, since an attenuation of 3dB is easily perceived by the human ear, this means that you are already significantly affecting the signal at the cutoff frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 4-pole filter will always tend to a 24dB/octave rolloff at high frequencies, but it will exhibit regions within which the rolloff is 6dB/octave, 12dB/octave, and 18dB/octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the differences are subtle or glaringly obvious, every analogue filter design sounds different from every other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every drummer knows that, when you hit a drum harder, its pitch rises. This means that the fundamental frequency is in some way related to the displacement of the membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect &apos;noise generator&apos; produces all audio frequencies simultaneously, and this is close enough to provide a basis for many analogue &apos;drum&apos; sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a &apos;ring modulator&apos; — a circuit that produces the dense cluster of non-harmonic overtones that are characteristic of metal sheets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Of Filters & Phase Relationships]]></title><description><![CDATA[when you mix two offset but otherwise identical signals, the phases of the individual frequencies define a filter. phase changes lead to…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-4/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/synth-secrets/part-4/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;when you mix two offset but otherwise identical signals, the phases of the individual frequencies define a filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;phase changes lead to filtering, can you assume that filtering leads to phase changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters not only change a waveform by attenuation, but distort it by individually phase-shifting the harmonics within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unvarying tones are called static or stationary sounds, and they are almost always musically uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control Voltage, or CV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage Controlled Amplifier, or VCA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagine using the knob to apply varying voltages to create a loudness &apos;contour&apos; for our sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the contour of the CV is identical to the loudness contour. In other words, you have defined the loudness of the sound at any given time using the CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envelope Generator, or EG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most common envelope generators, are called ADSRs. The acronym stands for Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of them — Attack, Decay, and Release — are measures of time, while the fourth — the Sustain — is a voltage level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this fundamental frequency lies in the range of approximately 20Hz to 20kHz you should hear the sound as an audible tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Frequency Oscillator, or LFO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tone Generator is a Signal Generator — it produces the basic audio tone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voltage Controlled Amplifier is an example of a Modifier — it changes the audio signal in some way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LFO Sinewave generator is acting as a Controller — it is directing the signal-modifying action of the Modifier itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an analogue synth uses fluctuating voltage to represent audio signals and other fluctuating voltages to shape and control them. But it&apos;s not a signal&apos;s source that is important, it&apos;s the destination that determines whether it is best viewed as an audio signal or a controller.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[More About Envelopes]]></title><description><![CDATA[there are many, many sounds that you can't imitate using ADSR 4-stage envelopes.

&lt;h4&gt;ADSR Limitations:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the voltage at the start of the contour has to be zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Attack phase of the contour always moves in a positive direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ADSR always reaches its maximum level at the end of the Attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Decay is always negative with respect to the Attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Sustain Level always begins at the level reached at the end of the Decay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Sustain is a constant voltage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Release starts at the Sustain Level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Release always moves in a negative direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Release always ends up back at zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Envelope Generators, or DEGs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many stages the contour generators on your synth have, you can usually recreate the contours of a envelope generator with fewer stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the complexity of the contour generators adds many possibilities for more detailed sound creation, without precluding the creation of simpler sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t become carried away by the current craze for vintage synths or their DSP-generated descendants. Think about the type of sounds you want to generate, and choose your instrument carefully so that you can produce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by adjusting the value of one or more components in a given filter circuit, you can adjust the cutoff frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all physical objects resonate. Or, to put it another way, almost all objects will vibrate naturally at certain frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common uses for VCAs is to modify the actions of CVs using other CVs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not differentiate between amplifiers in the audio signal chain and those used to modify control voltages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have more than one amplifier and/or attenuator in series, you can at any moment calculate the Gain of the whole system simply by multiplying the individual Gains — at each instant — together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we usually call an envelope generator may be only one contributor to the true envelope of a given parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many analogue monosynths generate three signals every time you press a key. The first is the pitch CV; it helps to determine the pitch of the sound produced, for any given key. The second is the Trigger. This is a pulse of short duration that, at the exact moment you press a key, can trigger the actions of devices such as transient generators. The third is the Gate. Like the Trigger, the Gate&apos;s leading edge tells other parts of the synth that you have pressed a key. However the Gate remains &apos;Open&apos; for the whole time that you depress the key. This means that it can also tell the rest of the synth the exact moment that you release the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a Trigger will initiate a transient generator, it&apos;s the Gate that tells the synth to continue developing the contour until the key is released. Without a Gate, all you would hear would be a short &apos;blip&apos; at the start of the sound, but nothing thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear a sound, your brain uses just the first few milliseconds to ascertain what instrument is producing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to recreate acoustic sounds or program interesting synthesizer sounds deterministically then, at the very least, you must be able to analyse and create the brightness and loudness contours of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create any waveform using nothing but sine waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental partials determine the pitch of the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sawtooth waveform is made up of all overtone partials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Square and triangle waveform are made up of odd-numbered partials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of adding sine waves together to create sounds is known as additive synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtractive synthesis is simply additive synthesis in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds created by synthesizer are referred to as patches.
A waveform&apos;s usefulness lies with the harmonics that make it up and is NOT inherent to the shape of the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using two oscillator gives more control over the harmonic makeup of the final sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulse-width is a variable-width pulse as a sound source. By changing the width of a pulse, it is possible to change its harmonic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncing is the ability to sync one oscillator to the other. For syncing to have any effect on the sound the synced oscillator must be tuned higher than the master oscillator. The slave must be tuned higher but if it is tuned at octave intervals syncing will have no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White noise maintains uniform power across all frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink noise diminishes in power by 3 dB per octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown noise diminishes in power by 6 dB per octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard pitch tracking allows the user to select whether or not the pitch of an oscillator will change as different keys are played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter cutoff keyboard tracking is used to either gradually increase or decrease the amount of filtering that take place as keys are played either up or down the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard tracking can be used to modify envelop times and amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphony refers to the number of keys that can be played and still produce sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesizers that only allow one note to be played at a time are called monophonic while synthesizers that allow multiple notes are polyphonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portamento, also known as glide, will cause the pitch to change gradually between two consecutively struck keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unison is used to create a chorusing-like effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pole is 6 dB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two poles are 12 dB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four poles are 24 dB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever frequencies are removed from a signal they no longer contribute to the overall power of the signal. Removing frequencies will result in an overall lower amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add vibrato or tremolo to a patch an LFO would be used to modulate the pitch and amplitude respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sine and triangle waves are the most ideal for imitating natural effects such as vibrato and tremolo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFOs can also be used to create rhythm. This is where the square and sawtooth sources become the most useful. Using either one of these sources and routing the LFO to modulate the amplitude or filter cutoff frequency can result in useful gating effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 8th Habit]]></title><description><![CDATA[8th Habit is to Find Your Voice and Inspire Others to Find Theirs.

&lt;p&gt;Voice is unique personal significance that lies at the nexus of talent, passion, need, and conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-Person Paradigm - human beings has four-dimensional body, mind, heart, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four needs of people: to learn, to live, to love, and to leave a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the great cultural shifts - ones that have built great organizations that sustain long-term growth, prosperity, and contribution to the world - started with the choice of one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They find and use their voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspire others to find their voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have the power to decide to live a great life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspire means to breathe life into another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learn best when you teach another and that learning is internalized when you live it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know and not to do, is really not to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only in the doing, the applying, that knowledge and understanding are internalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Birth-gifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom and Power to Choose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles - universal, timeless, and self-evident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4 Intelligences / Capacities - mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition person - one who stops unworthy tendencies from being passed on from prior generations to those that follow your children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we change our thinking, we change our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &quot;law of the harvest&quot; that governs human characters, human greatness and all human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a product of neither nature nor nurture; we are a product of choice, because there is always a space between stimulus and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders aren’t made or born; they are self-made - leadership is a function of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three leadership attributes: vision, discipline, and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things are created twice: first, a mental creation; second, a physical creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help others find their own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to creating passion in your life is to find your unique talents and your special role and purpose in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Know yourself, control yourself, give yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you use and magnify the gifts or talents you have been given, the more gifts and talents you are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing, doing, and becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organization is made up of individuals who have a relationship and a shared purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Four Primary Management Practices:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy - Devise and maintain a clearly stated, focused strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution - Develop and maintain flawless operation execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture - Develop and maintain a performance-oriented culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure - Build and maintain a fast, flexible, flat organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring Others to Find Their Voice involves FOCUS and EXECUTION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to influence is always to first be influenced, that is to first be open and seek understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90 percent of all leadership failures are character failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is the fruit of the trustworthiness of both people and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who we are is more important than who we appear to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustworthiness comes from character and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal character: integrity, maturity and the Abundance Mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make and keep promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationship are maintained and deepened only as you actively nurture and build them with regular acts of kindness, consideration, appreciation and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong relationships require real effort and sacrifice, they require putting someone else&apos;s well-being, growth and happiness before your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral Authority: The principled exercise of free choice, which almost always involves some form of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trust deposit must mean something to the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing destroys trust faster than making and breaking a promise and nothing build and strengthens trust more than keeping a promise you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lying makes a problem part of the future; truth makes a problem part of the past.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults are big children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is; treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is not only the fruit of trustworthiness; it is also the root of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love as a verb is something you do: the sacrifices you make and the giving of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think Win-Win is the idea or principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathic listening is to get deeply into the frame of reference of another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see the world as it is; we see the world as we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand does not mean to agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influence begins with modeling trustworthiness so that people will have confidence in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three primary roles of a leader - pathfinding, aligning, and empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always seek the higher Third Alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathfinding is the first creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alignment - designing and executing systems and structures that reinforce the core values and highest strategic priorities of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alignment is institutionalized trustworthiness - the very principles that people have built into their value system are the basis for designing structures, systems, and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form follows function. Structure follows purpose. Alignment follows pathfinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ask &quot;What do you think?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful organizations are system and culture dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success lies in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the principle of alignment is to always begin with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MODELING PRINCIPLE-CENTERED trustworthy behavior inspires trust without &quot;talking it.&quot; Pathfinding creates order without demanding it. Aligning nourishes both vision and empowerment with proclaiming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empowering enthrones self-control, self-management, and self-organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our greatest financial investment is the knowledge worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servant leadership is about the trust that is consciously given to another - an act that leads me to feel your belief that I can add value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duty, love and meaning are the highest sources of human motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus and Execution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The 4 Disciplines of Execution:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the Wildly Important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Compelling Scoreboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate Lofty Goals into Specific Actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold Each Other Accountable - All of the Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PRIMARY GREATNESS]]></title><description><![CDATA["Leadership is communicating to another person their worth and potential so clearly they are inspired to see it in themselves."

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to live: a life of primary greatness or a life of secondary greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary greatness is who you really are - your character, your integrity, your deepest motives and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary greatness is popularity, title, position, fame, fortune, and honors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary greatness is the kind of success that comes from contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful life is about primary greatness - a life of duty, honor, integrity, perseverance, self-sacrifice, and service, regardless of material rewards or circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden Rule - at our core, we know that outward success is failure if it isn&apos;t rooted in inner success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner character was far more significant a factor in success than talent or intelligence or circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can change because we have the power to choose how we will act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success is to align ourselves to unchangeable principles and stop taking detours away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret life is where your heart is, where your real motives are - the ultimate desires of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the ability to consciously choose your own motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you choose your own motives, you really can&apos;t choose to live your own life. Everything flows out of motives and motivation - they are the root of our deepest desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character, what you are, is ultimately more important than competence, what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courage and consideration are the key building blocks of emotional maturity, and that emotional maturity is foundational to all decisions and all relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional maturity is the ability to express your feeling and convictions with courage, balanced with consideration for the feelings and conviction of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to primary greatness is to be centered on principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building character and quality of life is a function of aligning our beliefs and behaviors with universal principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North star is universal, timeless, and self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Human Endowment: self-awareness, conscience, independent will, and creative imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic human needs: to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the product of our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A life of total integrity is the only one worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal integrity account - the amount of trust we have in ourselves, in our ability to walk our talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without alignment behind the same vision, and without being tried into the same value system based on principles, everything else gets messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beliefs about the world determine how we behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people cultivate an abundance mentality, they will think win-win. They will develop more self-respect and respect for others and show tremendous compassion and tenderness toward others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12 LEVERS OF SUCCESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF INTEGRITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about centering your life on the principle of total integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity is the child of two primary character traits: humility and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity means that your life is integrated around principles and that your security comes from within, not from with-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining &quot;the highest levels of honesty and credibility in all relationships.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us is a composite of three selves: the public self, the private self, and our deep, secret self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reveal authentically who you are deep down, people will learn to trust you for your genuineness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We judge others by their behavior, ourselves by our intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF CONTRIBUTION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary greatness is achieved by those who have a mission, a purpose to serve that is higher than themselves, a lasting contribution to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two side of leadership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private victory is the victory over self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The public victory is to get others to join you in the quest to achieve a shared vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF PRIORITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is not to prioritize what&apos;s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your unique talents and capabilities determine the important work you have to do in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not be governed by the efficiency of the clock; I will be governed by the compass of my conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People both want and need to feel that their lives and work have meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF SACRIFICE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy - the miracle that happens when everyone contributes their best thinking and nobody cares about getting credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will be open and listen to you and see what we can create together for our mutual benefit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can only bond with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrifice is the very essence of bonding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be more open and honest in your communication with no hidden agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to transformational partnerships is the willingness to sacrifice an old mindset and skillset and to move to the new mindset of interdependency and the new skillset of synergy, seeking first to understand while always looking for mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF SERVICE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giving of the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the many is the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deepest hunger of the human soul is to be recognized, valued, appreciated, and understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultivation of the spirit of servant leadership will teach everyone to be kind, respectful, and caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between the way employees are treated and how they treat customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our quality of our life depends on our own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you beautiful and lovely - your willingness to be open and authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF LOYALTY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be loyal to people who are absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF RECIPROCITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you give comes back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of your problems are in your character, and so are the root solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build your character and your relationships on the bedrock of principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal relationship provides a healthy return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF DIVERSITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without diversity, there is no synergy and, without synergy, nothing new happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the root of the ability to fully value and celebrate difference in others is having your own personal security tied to a shared vision, common purpose, and integrity based on principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we share a transcending purpose, common vision, and shared mission in our relationships, we can afford to have many differences, and they&apos;ll become strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF LEARNING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love of learning and the search for wisdom help make life worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have an obligation to learn and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security lies in the power to continually learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF RENEWAL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t achieve primary greatness by neglecting yourself - your health, your mind, your emotional and spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate personal synergy comes when we renew ourselves in physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions regularly, on both personal and professional levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE LEVER OF TEACHING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach them to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn something is to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three roles for every learner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing or understanding essential information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding or applying this knowledge into his own life for his own purposes and values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching others for their benefit and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to capture learning: purpose, main points, validation, application, and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this simple concept of teaching what you learn will pay big dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom - a perspective that embraces principles, continuous growth, and an integrated wholeness. It is a perspective that bring peace to the inner person and prosperity to the world. It is perspective that brings security because the principle upon which we live our lives are solid, enduring, and will never change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[THE SPEED OF TRUST]]></title><description><![CDATA["Trust changes everything."

&lt;p&gt;Trust is a pragmatic, tangible, actionable assets that you can create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust has a huge impact both in the quality of our lives and in the results we&apos;re able to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust means confidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships of all kinds are built on and sustained by trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can&apos;t trust ourselves, we&apos;ll have a hard time trusting other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fastest ways to restore trust is to make and keep commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust always affects two outcome - speed and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust truly is the one thing that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is one of the most powerful forms of motivation and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is a function of two things: character and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is getting results in a way that inspires trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE FIRST WAVE - SELF TRUST: The Principle of Credibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Inside-out&quot; approach: to build trust with others, we must first start with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your credibility depends on your integrity, your intent, your capabilities, and your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self Trust is all about credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Two Simple Questions:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I trust myself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I someone others can trust?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&apos;s self-confidence affects his or her performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we do make and keep a commitment to ourselves or set and achieve a meaningful goal, we become more credible. The more we do it, the more confidence we have that we can do it, that we will do it. The more we trust ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credibility is something we can do something about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4 Cores of Credibility:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Roddick Choice&quot; - demonstrating integrity even when it is costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Integrity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congruence is a person who has integrity when there is no gap between intent and behavior... when he or she is whole, seamless, the same - inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility is a humble person who is more concerned about what is right than about being right, about acting on good ideas than having the ideas, about embracing new truth than defending outdated position, about building the team than exalting self, about recognizing contribution than being recognized for making it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity also includes the courage to do the right thing - even when it&apos;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to increase Integrity:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make and keep commitments to yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand for something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent matters and it grows out of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tend to judge ourselves by our intent, we tend to judge others by their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perception of intent has a huge impact on trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for us to actively influence the conclusion others draw by &quot;declaring our intent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent is defined as &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motive is your reason for doing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motive that inspires the greatest trust is genuine caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda is what you intend to do or promote because of your motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda that generally inspires the greatest trust is seeking mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior is the manifestation of motive and agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior that best create credibility and inspires trust is acting in the best interest of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trustee standard&quot;: acting in the best interest of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People judge us and we judge them based on observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful to not interpret the intent of others by projecting your own intent onto their behavior and also to realize that often others may be interpreting your intent in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to improve your intent:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine and refine your motives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare your intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose abundance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capabilities - the talents, skills, knowledge, capacities, and abilities we have that enables us to perform with excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to constantly improve our capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Technical abilities&quot; - those skills that are specific to our job or situation or particular task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust abilities&quot; - the ability to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to increase your capabilities:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run with your strengths and with your purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep yourself relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know where you&apos;re going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results matter to your credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being good at your job and being good at fitting into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our credibility comes not only from our past results and our present results, but also from the degree of confidence others have in our ability to produce results in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to improve your results:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect to win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THE SECOND WAVE - RELATIONSHIP TRUST: The Principle of Behavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationship trust is all about consistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that in every relationship personal and professional - what you do has far greater impact than anything you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can and do change behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Paradigm shifts&quot; - changes in way you see or think about things that create significant changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Behavior shifts&quot; - shifts in doing that actually change the way you see and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can behave yourself into the kind of person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Trust accounts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each trust account is unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All deposits and withdrawals are not created equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What constitutes a &quot;deposit&quot; to one person may not to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawals are typically larger than deposits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the fastest way to build trust is to stop making withdrawals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that each relationship has two trust accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that every interaction with every person is a &quot;moment of trust&quot;. The way you behave in that moment will either build or diminish trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By behaving in ways that build trust with one, you build trust with many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #1: TALK STRAIGHT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TELL THE TRUTH AND LEAVE THE RIGHT IMPRESSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the right impression means communicating so clearly that you cannot be misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #2: DEMONSTRATE RESPECT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to behave in ways that show fundamental respect for people and second, to behave in ways that demonstrate caring and concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #3: CREATE TRANSPARENCY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to build trust professionally and personally is by being trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create transparency - is about being open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about being real and genuine and telling the truth in a way people can verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #4: RIGHT WRONGS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s doing what you can to correct the mistake... and then a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make things right when you&apos;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #5: SHOW LOYALTY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show loyalty is giving credit to others, and speaking about people as though they were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #6: DELIVER RESULTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results give you instant credibility and instant trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing results almost always gives a person more choices, more options, more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #7: GET BETTER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people see you as a learning, growing, renewing person or your organization as a learning, growing, renewing organization - they develop confidence in your ability to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, enabling you to build high trust relationships and move with incredible speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not what you know, it&apos;s how fast you can learn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek feedback and learn from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #8: CONFRONT REALITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confront reality is about taking the tough issues head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t afraid to deliver bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #9: CLARIFY EXPECTATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarify expectations is to create shared vision and agreement about what is to be done up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Clarity is power.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #10: PRACTICE ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First hold yourself accountable and second hold others accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #11: LISTEN FIRST&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To listen first means not only to really listen, but to do it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leadership ultimately means understanding people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen with your eyes for feeling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen for as well as to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to yourself, to your gut feeling, your own inner voice, before you decide, before you act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #12: KEEP COMMITMENTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you make a commitment, you build hope; when you keep it, you build trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making and keeping commitments to yourself is the key to success in making and keeping commitments to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BEHAVIOR #13: EXTEND TRUST&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to not trust people who don&apos;t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extend trust abundantly to those who have earned your trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extend trust conditionally to those who are earning your trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE THIRD WAVE - ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST: The Principle of Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about designing and aligning systems that promote trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust is the most significant predictor of individuals&apos; satisfaction within their organizations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A symbol of trust is a symbol that inspired loyalty and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE FOURTH WAVE - MARKET TRUST: The Principle of Reputation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market trust is all about brand and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust is a key building block in the creation of a company&apos;s reputation, and as a direct result, its shareholder value.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever trust we are able to create in our organizations and in the marketplace is a result of the credibility we first create in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE FIFTH WAVE - SOCIETAL TRUST: The Principle of Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is an integral part of the fabric of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societal trust is contribution and the intent to create value instead of destroy, to give back instead of take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Universal mission statement&quot;: To increase the economic well-being and quality of life of all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ability to appropriately extend trust to others is the single most impactful factor in creating a high-trust environment, both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first job of a leader is to inspire trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Propensity to trust&quot; is primarily a matter of the heart, to believe that people are worthy of trust and a desire to extend it to them freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Analysis&quot; is primarily a matter of the mind, the ability to come up with logical decisions and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Smart trust&quot; is to combine the propensity to trust with the analysis to manage risk wisely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HIGH PERFORMANCE HABITS]]></title><description><![CDATA[To become a high performer, you must seek clarity, generate energy, raise necessity, increase productivity, develop influence, and…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/high-performance-habits/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/high-performance-habits/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To become a high performer, you must seek clarity, generate energy, raise necessity, increase productivity, develop influence, and demonstrate courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performer - someone who creates ever-increasing levels of both well-being and external success over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance refers to succeeding beyond standard norms, consistently over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance is about forming habits that help you both excel in and enrich the full spectrum of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is achieved not by a specific type of person, but rather by people from all walk of life who enact a specific set of practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Personal Habits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Social Habits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seek Clarity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Increase Productivity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generate Energy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Develop Influence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Raise Necessity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demonstrate Courage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #1: SEEK CLARITY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about how you think about tomorrow and what you do stay connected with what matters today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential habit of seeking clarity help high performers stay engaged, growing, and fulfilled over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers have more clarity on who they are, what they want, how to get it, and what they find meaningful and fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarity is the child of careful thought and mindful experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to know who you are, what you value, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear &quot;stretch&quot; goals energize us and lead to greater enjoyment, productivity, profitability, and satisfaction in our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a specific plan attached to your goals - knowing when and where you will do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - ENVISION THE FUTURE FOUR&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers are more focused on sculpting themselves into stronger and more capable people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are living into their best self now. Imagine your best future self and start acting like that person today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOCIAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers anticipate positive social interactions and they strive consciously and consistently to create them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKILLS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers are very clear about the skills sets they need to develop now to win in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers are also working on skills that focus in their primary field of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter your current level of performance, clarifying your primary field of interest and the skills you need to master for your next level of success must be a priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SERVICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone becomes disconnected from the future and their contribution to it, they underperform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers give an extraordinary amount of thought to questions of service: how to add value, inspire those around them, and make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - DETERMINE THE FEELING YOU&apos;RE AFTER&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this situation, and what is the primary feeling I want to get from this situation?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of an emotion as mostly a reaction, and feeling is an interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers contemplate how they want to feel regardless of what emotions might come up, and they envision how they want to feel leaving the situation regardless of what emotions might come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My automatic emotion doesn’t have to be in charge. My feelings are my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers are generating the feelings they want more often than taking the emotions that land on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - DEFINE WHAT&apos;S MEANINGFUL&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers spend more of their time doing things that they find meaningful, and this makes them happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our striving for a meaningful life is one of the main factors associated with psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to bring more conscious and consistent thought to what you will find meaningful in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #2: GENERATE ENERGY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers have the magical trifecta of capital &quot;E&quot; Energy - that holistic kind that includes positive and enduring mental, physical, and emotional vibrancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy isn&apos;t just physical, it&apos;s also mental alertness and positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more energy someone has, the more likely they are to be happy and climb to the top of their primary field of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is the ultimate energy and well-being killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can transform your thoughts into feeling you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you don&apos;t have to &quot;wait&quot; for joy, motivation, love, excitement, or any other positive emotion in life. You can choose to generate it, on demand, any time you want, through the power of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - REALEASE TENSION, SET INTENTION&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master transitions where transitions are going between two activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REALEASE TENSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can choose to take a break, meditate, or any other ways to deal with stress before starting the next activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SET INTENTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think about what you want to feel and achieve in the next activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - BRING THE JOY&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers experience these three positive emotions: joy, presence, and mindfulness/flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on bring more joy into your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive emotion is one of the greatest predictors of the good life - high energy and high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel joy, your mind, body, and emotional reality all get a lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive emotion is a prerequisite for high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only you are in charge of your enduring emotional experience. You&apos;re in charge of how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciously direct your thoughts and behaviors to generate positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is the golden frame through which we see the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - OPTIMIZE HEALTH&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers always improve their energy with physical movements and breathing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase our physical energy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise - work out more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrition - eat healthier food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep - aim for seven to eight hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising help release tension and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #3 - RAISE NECESSITY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason, mastery demands all of a person&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necessity is the emotional drive that makes great performance a must instead of a preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike weaker desires that make you want to do something; necessity demands that you take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it&apos;s absolutely necessary to excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance necessity is one of the most powerful drivers of human motivation and excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Forces of Necessity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identity - High Personal Standards and Commitment to Excellence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers hold themselves to a high standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always self-monitoring and are self-aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers make their dream a necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsession - Obsession with Understanding and Mastering a Topic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers are curious for understanding and master their primary field of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers don&apos;t need a reward or prod from others to do something, because they find it inherently rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duty - Social Duty, Obligation, and Purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers often feel the necessity to perform well out of a sense of duty to someone or something beyond themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgency - Real Deadlines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performance happens only when there are real deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers are more focused on doing what really matters when it matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - KNOW WHO NEEDS YOUR &quot;A&quot; GAME&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on your &quot;A&quot; game means that you are giving your best effort with full focus on the singular task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll have to immerse yourself fully in activities that force you to stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can stoke the necessity to be your best in order to help others, you&apos;ll hit high performance faster and stay there longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - AFFIRM THE WHY&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers confidently affirm their goals to themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is saying with confidence that something is true and will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - LEVEL UP YOUR SQUAD&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you truly want to increase your performance in any area of your life, get around some new people who expect and value high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s so important to carefully curate who is in your social circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can improve your life on your own however social support makes personal development and overall life success easier, faster, and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers spend more time with positive people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are more strategic and consistent in seeking to work with others at or above their level of competence, experience, or overall success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend more time hanging with your positive and successful peers and building a new positive peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be deliberate about raising your level of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are only as strong and extraordinary as you give yourself reason to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #4: INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers score well on statements such as &quot;I&apos;m good at setting priorities and working on what&apos;s important,&quot; and &quot;I stay focused and avoid distractions and temptations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental of becoming more productive are setting goals and maintaining energy and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most people feel that they&apos;re out of balance, it&apos;s because one area of their life become more intense, important, and time-consuming than other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area of life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intimate Relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mission/Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adventure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirituality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll always feel out of balance if you&apos;re doing work that you don&apos;t find engaging and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a brief break away from the desk at least every 45 to 60 minutes to increase satisfaction and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - INCREASE THE OUTPUTS THAT MATTER&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers have mastered the art of prolific quality output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real work is producing quality output that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what you are supposed to produce, and learning the priorities in the creation, quality, and frequency of that output, is one of the greatest breakthroughs you can have in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - CHART YOUR FIVE MOVES&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become a high performer request thinking more before acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of five projects that move you toward achieving your dream can then be broken down into deliverables, deadlines, and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the big five moves that will take you to your goal, break those moves down into tasks and deadlines, then put them in a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - GET INSANELY GOOD AT KEY SKILLS&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to master the primary skills needed to win in your primary fields of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is trainable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get better at practically anything if you keep a growth mindset, focus on your goals with passion, and perseverance, and practice with excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ensure that you become world-class in that skill through progressive mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progression mastery involves getting a coach, challenging yourself beyond your comfort zones, developing mental representations of what success should be, tracking your progress, and fixing your weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #5: DEVELOP INFLUENCE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matter is your perception of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary skills you must master in life is influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influencers understand the power of repetition, so they try multiple times to get their ideas in front of those they hope to influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t forget to give, giving to others with no expectation of return increases your overall success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can double your ability to influence others by giving before you ask for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers have a giving mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ultimate Influence Model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach them how to think about themselves, others, and the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge them to develop their character, connections, and contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role model the values you wish to see them embody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three things you want your followers thinking about themselves, other people, and the greater world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO GROW&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers challenge the people around them to rise to higher levels of performance themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your intentions are clearly to help someone grow and become better, and you speak to them with respect and honor, then your challenges will inspire better action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influencers challenge other in three realms: their character, their connections with others, and their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - ROLE MODEL THE WAY&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers give a lot of time thinking about being a role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers act in ways that gets someone to improve who they are, or achieve a specific result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers just don&apos;t do manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #6: DEMONSTRATE COURAGE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers are courageous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers report taking action despite fear much more than others do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courage is not fearlessness; it is taking action and persisting despite that fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we do something successfully, the more comfortable we become with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more actions you take facing fear, expressing yourself, and helping others, the easier and less stressful these actions become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral courage is speaking up for others or enduring hardship for what you believe is right, to serve the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological courage is the act of facing or overcoming your own anxieties, insecurities, and mental fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday courage could mean keeping a positive attitude or taking action despite great uncertainty, bad health, or hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that you define what being more courageous means to you, and start living that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - HONOR THE STRUGGLE&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll have to get better at dealing with life&apos;s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the struggle as part of our growing character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance requires real intention and the mastering of complex habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we learn to see struggles as a necessary, important, and positive part of our journey, then we can find true peace and personal power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggle must be seen as part of the process and a vitally important part of any worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the suck. You have to deal with it, face it, and will yourself to persevere and rise. You will make it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you are stronger than you think, and the future hold good things for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - SHARE YOUR TRUTH AND AMBITIONS&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we live our truth, expressing who we really are, how we really feel, what we really desire and dream of, then we are authentic, we are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only path is to express your own truth and pursue your own dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - FIND SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from wanting to serve another, to love another, to fight for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do more for others than for ourselves. And in doing something for others, we find our reason for courage, and our cause for focus and excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The 3 C&apos;s OF CONFIDENCE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE ONE - DEVELOP COMPETENCE&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers are learners, and their belief that they can learn what is necessary to win in the future gives them as much confidence as their current skills sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE TWO - BE CONGRUENT&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shaped their identity by conscious will and have aligned their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to support that identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PRACTICE THREE - ENJOY CONNECTION&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performers have learned the tremendous value in relating with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Radical Candor]]></title><description><![CDATA[At the very heart of being a good boss - is a good relationship.

&lt;p&gt;Your key responsibility as a boss: to guide your team to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosses guide a team to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three areas of responsibility that managers do have: guidance, team-building, and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Radical Candor&quot; is what happens when you put &quot;Care Personally&quot; and &quot;Challenge Directly&quot; together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bring your whole self to work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two dimensions to good guidance: care personally and challenge directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from their work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[THE BUS COMPRESSION FRAMEWORK]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bus compression does two things: Glue instruments together Allow us to manipulate the overall transient and volume characteristics of entire…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-bus-comperssion-framework/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-bus-comperssion-framework/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bus compression does two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glue instruments together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow us to manipulate the overall transient and volume characteristics of entire groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bus compression or pocket compression is a group of instruments that are all being affected by the same compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mixing in the pocket&quot; is the ability to create zones, or distinct spaces in your mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency Pocket = EQing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compression Pocket = Bus Compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front = Contrast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back = Blend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front Pocket = Slower Attack and Faster Release&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back Pocket = Faster Attack and Slower Release&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5 types of buses/groups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leads/Vox - Front Pocket (Glue + Depth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pads/Keys - Back Pocket (Glue + Depth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drum Bas - Drum Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bass Bus - Bass Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aux Bus - Auxiliary Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Back Pocket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send all the instruments you want positioned in the Back Space of your mix to this bus/group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack .1 - 3ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release .3 - .6sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio: 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you have 1 - 2db of gain reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it&apos;s necessary to restore any lost volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Front Pocket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send all the instruments you want positioned in the Front Space of your mix to this bus/group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10 - 30ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release .1 - .3sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio: 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you have .5 - 1db of gain reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it&apos;s necessary to restore any lost volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drum Pocket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send all your drums to the drum bus/group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10 - 30ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release .1 - .3sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio: 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your Threshold until you have .5 - 3db of gain reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it&apos;s necessary to restore any lost volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bass Pocket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send all your basses to this bass bus/group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release .1 - .3sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio: 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your Threshold down until you have .5 - 1db of gain reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it&apos;s necessary to restore any lost volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aux Pocket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send all Auxiliary sounds; FX to this bus/group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 1 - 3ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release .3 - .6sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio: 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you have 1 - 2db of gain reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it&apos;s necessary to restore any lost volume.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-decay reverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium-decay reverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-decay reverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer the decay the more space it takes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3-Space Mix Theory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blend/Contrast Theory and Reverb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverbs by default will blend together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create more contrast with reverbs we use numerically different settings between each reverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important parameters in any reverb are &lt;strong&gt;pre-delay&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;decay&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;hi-cut&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front Space Categories: Drums, Small Rooms, Studios, Chambers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Space Categories: Chambers, Halls, Medium Rooms, Studios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back Space Categories: Chambers, Halls, Cathedrals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mod Depth is the depth of pitch modulation happening within your reverb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mod Rate is how fast the pitch modulation move up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher the mod rate, the less mod depth you can have for the reverb to sound natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lower the mod rate, the more mod depth you can have for the reverb to sound natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A darker reverb will have bass frequencies that last longer relative to the high frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brighter reverb will have bass frequencies which decay faster relative to high frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a darker room then make sure the high frequency content decays faster than your bass frequency content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a brighter room then make sure the low frequency content decays faster than your high frequency content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front space is created by using short-decay reverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle space is created by using medium-decay reverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back space is created by using long-decay reverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Front Space Reverb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predelay: 1 - 10ms
Decay: .2 - 1sec
Hicut: 10k - 20k
Diffusion: To taste. Low diffusion create a more lively, and echoey drum room. High diffusion creates a smoother drum room.
Mod Rate/Depth: Mod depth is somewhere between 5 - 20%
EQ: A drum room&apos;s low frequencies should disappear before its high frequencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Middle Space Reverb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predelay: 10 - 20ms
Decay: 1 - 2sec
Hicut: 8k - 15k
Diffusion: Set to taste
Mod Rate/Depth: Between 5 - 30%
EQ: Should complement your long-decay reverb&apos;s EQ in such a way that they give each other space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Back Space Reverb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predelay: 1 - 15ms
Decay: 2 - 8sec
Hicut: 5k - 12k
Diffusion: Usually always at max
Mod Rate/Depth: Between 15 - 50%
EQ: Has the most natural bass decay&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MASTERING MULTI-BAND COMPRESSION]]></title><description><![CDATA[A multiband compressor is really just an EQ that has a regular single-band compressor attached to each EQ band. Compression is just a way…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/mastering-multi-band-compression/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/mastering-multi-band-compression/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A multiband compressor is really just an EQ that has a regular single-band compressor attached to each EQ band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compression is just a way for us to control volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want compression for you to mean an Automatic Volume Fader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The 3 Truths About Compression&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compressor is just an automatic volume fader, controls for this is threshold, ratio, attack, and release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything a compressor can do, volume automation can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressors make loud sounds quieter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at a multiband compressor as a dynamic EQ, where dynamic means differences in volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an EQ you have separate frequency bands that you can boost or cut. Boosting or cutting is exactly like moving a volume fader up or down for a given frequency band. However with an EQ the volume fader is static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a multiband compressor that same volume fader can automatically move up and down in response to the loudness of the incoming signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic EQing = Multiband Compression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An EQ is a static adjustment to the shape of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a multiband compressor to act dynamically, the signal going into it must also be dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Frequency Band&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multiband compressor allows you to independently select and treat frequency ranges with compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Blend/Contrast Theory&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is decide if an instrument is blending or contrasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure there&apos;s 1 instrument that&apos;s louder &lt;strong&gt;contrasting&lt;/strong&gt;, and the rest are just supporting &lt;strong&gt;blending&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blend/contrast is a universal art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front = Contrast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back = Blend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2 main results Multiband Compression can achieve:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transient Control - means shaping the peak volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transient Enhancement will always = More Contrast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transient Reduction will always = More Blend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume Leveling - reducing the difference between loud and quiet portions so it stays in place and not moving front or back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiband compressing at the individual track or group level is actaully what gives you the most control over your entire mix, and it leads to the best mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the rule to do cutting based EQ decision before compressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Techniques&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Transient Enhancement of Plucky Sounds&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band from 1khz - 20khz on the desired instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Makeup Gain +6db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until you get 4 - 6db of reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Transient Reduction of Plucky Sounds&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band from 1khz - 20khz on the desired instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 0ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until the transient disappears just a little more than nescessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set attack 2 - 10ms to get back some transient information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Controlling Sweeping Resonant Peaks&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play an instrument with a sweeping and very resonant filter. You&apos;ll see the resonant peak sweeping across the frequency spectrum on the spectrum analyzer. As it sweeps notice where it begins to stick out in your mix. Wherever it starts and wherever it ends will be the boundaries of your compression band. Usually 800hz - 7khz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until you get enough gain reduction to prevent the offending resonant frequency range from poking out in your mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Controlling Frequency Peaks at the Group/Bus Level&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the Multiband Compressor on the group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set just one Frequency Band at 800hz - 5khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack to 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release to 20 - 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio to 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the entire mix plays, bring the Threshold down until it catches the specific parts where the volume builds up in that frequency range and swamps your lead instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Shaping Snare Body&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band 100hz - 300hz, or just so the frequency band is center on the snare bump you see on a spectrum analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Attack to 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Release to 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Ratio to 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Makeup Gain until you get the fullness and body you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now bring the Threshold down until you like the body shape you&apos;ve got&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Shaping Snare Snap&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band to between 5khz - 20khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack to 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release to 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 4:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 2 - 4db of makeup gain, just like you&apos;re EQ boosting the high frequency content of the sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you get 2 - 4db of compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Adding Kick Punch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band 80hz - 120hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1 or 4:1 depending on the desired aggressiveness of the effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 1 - 6db Makeup Gain depending on how much punch you&apos;d like to have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you get the sound you want or you&apos;ve got 1 - 6db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Removing Kick Woofiness&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Band somewhere between 150hz - 800hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find the problem frequencies faster by bringing the makeup gain of that band down -6db and then sliding the band left to right until you get the biggest improvement. Reset the gain to 0 when you&apos;ve found your range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack to 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release to 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the Threshold down until you get whatever amount of gain reduction makes your kick sound the best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Strengthening the Bod of a Sound&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Band to 120hz - 600hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 1 - 4db of Makeup Gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now bring the Threshold down until you get about 2 - 3db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Compressing Sub Frequencies for More Power usually on master channel&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band from 0hz - 150hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack to 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release to 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until it only triggers 1 - 3db of compression when your kick and bass hit at the same time before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Multiband Compressing for Increased Front/Back Depth for supprting instruments&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we need to do is multiband compress whichever frequency ranges of our supporting instruments get most in the way of our leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Frequency Band to 800hz - 5khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your Threshold down until you get .5 - 2db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Multiband Compressing Reverb for Increased Front/Back Depth&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique is about sending all your reverb sends in a mix to the same group and then on that group you have a multiband compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route all your Reverbs to the same group/bus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Multiband Compressor to the Reverb group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Frequency Band 1khz - 5khz this is the main area for leads and important stuff in your mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 60 - 100ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the entire track is playing during a busy part bring the Threshold down until you get .5 - 2db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sidechain Multiband Compression for Increased Kick Punch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique works when you have all your bass instruments coming into a group where you can put a multiband compressor on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Low Frequency Band from 0hz - 150hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 0ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 40ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As your entire mix is playing, bring down the Threshold of your compressor until you feel you&apos;ve opened just enough space for your kick to punch through more cleanly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sidechain Multiband Compresion for Improved Lead Clarity&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Multiband Compressor to the supporting instrument group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Frequency Band on the supporting instrument group. The range of the frequency band will be across the main frequency region of your lead usually 1khz - 8khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route the lead to the Sidechain of the multiband compressor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30 - 60ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As everything plays, bring your Threshold down until you get some gain reduction and a pleasant kind of ducking of just that frequency range in the supporting instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Vocal De-Essing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a Frequency Band from 3khz - 7khz. Everyone&apos;s a bit different so you&apos;ll have to sweep the band in solo to find the epicenter of a person&apos;s sibilance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until compression is only being triggered by the sibilance of the performer. It&apos;&apos;s ok if it triggers slightly on other sounds too. You just want it triggering more on the S because that&apos;s where you&apos;ve set it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Broadcast Vocals&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bass Band: From 0 - 150hz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midrange Band: From 600hz - 5khz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence and Clarity Band: From 8khz - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting smooth broadcast vocals by boosting of the &amp;#x3C;150hz frequencies, a reducing in the 800hz - 5khz range to allow for more volume without harshness and a compression of 8khz+ to soften the pseudo-sibilance that&apos;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Bass Band:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 0hz - 150hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 25ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start adding 1 - 5db of Makeup Gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring down the Threshold to catch any of the already loud portions of your vocals bass frequencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Midrange Band:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 800hz - 5khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While listening to the voice, bring down the Threshold until it sounds smoother and less in your face nasally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Presence and Clarity Band:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 5khz - 20khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until you get .5 - 2db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Peak Control on Master Channel&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-Zone Mix Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bass: 0hz - 150hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body: 150hz - 800hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence: 800hz - 7khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail and Sizzle: 7khz - 20khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Bass:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 0 - 150hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 25ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 30ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until you have 1 - 3db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Body if you need peak control:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 150hz - 800hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 20ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until any peaks get reduced to a level you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Presence:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 800hz - 5khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 15ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until the transients of your kick and snare start to trigger compression. You want about 1 - 3db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Detail and Sizzle:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Frequency Range from 7khz - 20khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Attack 5 - 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Release 5 - 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Ratio 2:1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring Threshold down until you get .5 - 2db of gain reduction&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mix can be thought of as having two spaces &lt;strong&gt;Front&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Back&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Instruments that are up Front:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have more volume compared to instruments in the back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have more high frequency content compared to instruments in the back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to have less reverb because things that have lots of reverb get pushed further back than things which don&apos;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Instruments that are up Back:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have less volume compared to instruments up front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have less high frequency content compared to instruments up front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to have more reverb than the instruments up front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;EQ has two primary uses:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To sculpt and shape the presentation of your instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To control the balance between instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Two main approaches to EQ:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutting EQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosting EQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The 4 Zones&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lows: 0hz - 200hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mids: 200hz - 1khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Mids: 1khz - 7khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highs: 7khz - 20khz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule of 300 states that if it isn&apos;t bass, kick or snare, then you must high pass those instruments at 300hz or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Pass Filtering: is used to remove unwanted low frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Pass Filtering: is used to remove unwanted high frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting/Boosting aka Peak Filtering: is when you take a bell-shaped filter and use it to either subtract or add frequencies to a selected range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelving Filters: make something Brighter/Darker or Thicker/Thinner. Set at 1khz or higher, you can make a sound Brighter or Darker sounding. Set at 1khz or less, you make a sound Thicker or Thinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: is a way to adjust the sharpness of EQ curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Slingshotting goal is to aim for openness&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide where to put the instrument in the front or back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your desire volume to play in front or back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Q slope of 1 and select 4db boost for front or -6db for the back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With everything playing move your cut/boost between each of the 4 frequency zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you find your zone, refine your dB amount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real art of mixing is about the Frequency Real Estate you don&apos;t use, not the space you occupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less is more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&apos;s too many instruments fighting for dominance in a given frequency range, then when we go to limit our track, we increase the intensity of those clashing frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Frequency Sweeping&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency sweeping is more surgical and precise, involves a very narrow Q with around + or - 10db of gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;4 truths about compression&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compression is just an automatic volume fader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything a compressor can do; volume automation can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressor are designed to make loud sounds quieter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compressor is just a glorified volume fader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Fader Triggering, when to move down and how much volume to subtract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidechain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Fader Velocity, how fast it should move when volume is louder than your threshold&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher the ratio, the more gain-reduction. The lower the ratio, the less gain-reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sidechain&apos;s purpose is to allow the compressor to act as if it were behaving in response to an EQ&apos;d version of the sound you&apos;re treating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gain reduction means reducing the volume of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attack is how long it takes our automatic volume fader to move downward when the threshold is exceeded by our incoming signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release is how long it will take our automatic volume fader to return back to its original position of 0 volume reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold is a way to delay the release phase of our automatic volume fader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makeup Gain allows us to restore our instrument to its original perceived volume level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll learn that you have frequency pockets which are managed by EQ&apos;s and you have volume leveled pockets which are managed by compression. Having these distinct pockets in your mix means your mixes will have more depth, and therefore more blend and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chapter 3T - NOISE GENERATORS, FILTERS, AND SUBTRACTIVE SYNTHESIS]]></title><description><![CDATA[A filter is a signal processing device that acts selectively on some of the frequencies contained in a signal, applying attenuation or boost…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/chapter-3T/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/chapter-3T/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;filter&lt;/strong&gt; is a signal processing device that acts selectively on some of the frequencies contained in a signal, applying attenuation or boost to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of most digital filters is to alter the spectrum of a sound in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtractive synthesis&lt;/strong&gt; was born from the idea that brand-new sounds can be created by modifying, through the use of filters, the amplitude of some of the spectral components of other sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White noise&lt;/strong&gt; a sound that contains all audible frequencies, whose spectrum is essentially flat the amplitudes of individual frequencies being randomly distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink noise&lt;/strong&gt; similar to white noise, but has a spectrum whose energy drops as frequency rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Band-limited oscillators&lt;/strong&gt; are built so that their component frequencies never rise above half of the sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember you can only attenuate or boost frequencies that are already present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;lowpass filter&lt;/strong&gt; attenuates all of the frequencies above a cutoff frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;high pass filter&lt;/strong&gt; attenuates all of the frequencies below the cutoff frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;bandpass filter&lt;/strong&gt; attenuates the frequencies above and below a certain &lt;strong&gt;passband&lt;/strong&gt;, defined as a continuous zone of frequencies delimited by upper and lower bounds called its &lt;strong&gt;cutoff frequencies&lt;/strong&gt;.  Think in terms of &lt;strong&gt;bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;center frequency&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;band reject&lt;/strong&gt; filter the term bandwidth refers to a zone of frequencies to be attenuated rather than passed unaltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majority of filter allow you to specify a center frequency plus a resonance factor for the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Q factor&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as $Q = center frequency / bandwidth$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q factor presents bandwidth in relation to the center frequency. When holding Q steady, bandwidth varies as a function of the center frequency, and it is the ratio between the center frequency and the bandwidth that remains constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with high Q values, it is also possible to encounter an effect called &lt;strong&gt;ringing&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an oscillation produced by &lt;strong&gt;transients&lt;/strong&gt; that remains active after the transients have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;order&lt;/strong&gt; of the filter defines the curve with which frequencies are attenuated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In digital filters the frequency region near the cutoff frequency is called the &lt;strong&gt;transition zone&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is marked by roll-off attenuation that can be more or less steep depending on the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chapter 2T - ADDITIVE AND VECTOR SYNTHESIS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Any sound is a set of complex oscillations.

&lt;p&gt;Sine waves are the basic building blocks with which it is possible to construct all other waveforms. They are self-describing and they contain only themselves as components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of frequencies, amplitudes, and phases that completely define a given sound is called its &lt;strong&gt;sound spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waveform&lt;/strong&gt; is the graphical representation of amplitude as a function of time also known as time domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;sound spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; is a graph which the amplitude of the components is shown as a function of frequency also known as frequency domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to see the evolution of components over time, we can use a graph called a &lt;strong&gt;sonogram&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;spectrogram&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additive synthesis&lt;/strong&gt; in theory enables us to create any waveform at all by building up a sum of sine waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the amplitudes of A and B are both positive or both negative, the absolute value of the amplitude of C will be larger than that of either of the component, resulting in &lt;strong&gt;constructive interference&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the amplitudes of A and B differ in their signs, one being positive and the other negative, the absolute value of their sum C will be less than either one or both components, resulting in &lt;strong&gt;destructive interference&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;pure sound&lt;/strong&gt; has a sine waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest component frequency in a complex sound is called the &lt;strong&gt;fundamental&lt;/strong&gt;, and the other components are called &lt;strong&gt;harmonics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The components of a sound are integer multiples of the fundamental, the sound is called a &lt;strong&gt;harmonic sound&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the pure sounds composing a complex sound are not integer multiples of the lowest frequency component, we have &lt;strong&gt;non-harmonic components&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;partials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to obtain a polarity-reversed waveform consists of multiplying every sample value by -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line traced over the harmonic or non-harmonic spectrum is called the &lt;strong&gt;spectral envelope&lt;/strong&gt;: it is a curve that connects the tops of the bars that represent the amplitude of the harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds can contain both harmonic and non-harmonic components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two waves have the same frequency, but not necessarily the same amplitude, and if their positive and negative peaks coincide, we say that they are &lt;strong&gt;in phase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two interfering sounds create beats or the sensation of roughness rather than two distinct sounds, we say that the respective frequencies lie within a &lt;strong&gt;critical band&lt;/strong&gt; delineates boundaries within which our ears cannot separate individual sounds; instead, we resolve the complexity of such a signal with a sensation of roughness or by hearing beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossfading between wavetables is a technique called wavetable crossfading, vector synthesis, and linear algorithmic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sound effect known as &lt;strong&gt;infinite glissando&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Shepard tone&lt;/strong&gt; can be generated by using vector synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Electronic Music and Sound Design - Theory and Practice with Max 7 Volume 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[LIST OF PRINCIPLE COMMANDS Open a new Max document <Command-n/Control-n> Switch between edit mode and performance mode <Command-e/Control-e…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/electronic-music-and-sound-design/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;LIST OF PRINCIPLE COMMANDS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal processing&lt;/strong&gt; means the electronic modification of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency, amplitude and waveform are three basic parameters of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Each one of these parameters influences how we perceive sound:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our ability to distinguish a lower pitch from a higher one, frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our ability to distinguish a loud sound from a soft sound, amplitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our ability to distinguish different timbres, waveform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency&lt;/strong&gt; is the physical parameter that determines the pitch of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second key parameter for sound is &lt;strong&gt;amplitude&lt;/strong&gt;, which expresses information about variations in sound pressure, and which allows us to distinguish a loud sound from one of weaker intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Table relating raw amplitudes, normalized to a maximum value of 1, to amplitudes measured in dB SPL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Amplitude&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;db SPL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-inf&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that above 2,000 Hz, if we increase the intensity of a sound while maintaining fixed frequency, we will perceive that the pitch is rising, while below 1,000 Hz, as intensity increases, there will be a perceived drop in the pitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency also influences our perception of its intensity: the sensitivity of the ear to volume decreases at higher frequencies, increases in the midrange, and decreases greatly at low frequencies. &lt;strong&gt;This means that the amplitudes of two sounds must differ, depending on their frequencies, in order to produce the same perceived sensation of intensity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third key parameter of sound from the perceptual point of view is &lt;strong&gt;timbre&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;oscillator&lt;/strong&gt;: an electroacoustic device that can be simulated on the computer, generating signals with specific waveforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sinusoid&lt;/strong&gt; is both the simplest waveform and the most important one. It is the only waveform that contains a single frequency; all other waveforms are composed of multiple frequencies, and because of this, can be decomposed into a series of sinusoids, each of which contains the energy of a single component frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four classic waveforms are: &lt;strong&gt;sine wave&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;square wave&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sawtooth wave&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;triangle wave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that positive amplitudes, greater than zero, correspond to compression of the molecules of the transmission medium, while negative amplitudes correspond to rarefaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bipolar waves&lt;/strong&gt; have both positive and negative portions within their wave cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unipolar waves&lt;/strong&gt; lie completely above or below the value 0, are often used to modify a parameter of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sound cannot switch suddenly from silence to its maximum amplitude. A finite time, however brief, is needed, during which the sound in question can evolve to its new state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the amplitude of a sound can be divided into four basic parts: &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Decay&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sustain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Release&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the amplitude of a sound is called the &lt;strong&gt;envelope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of transients plays an essential role in the definition of timbre by the listener.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fashioning an envelope on the computer, we must be careful to avoid large instantaneous changes in amplitude. Abrupt changes will result in audible clicks within the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;glissando&lt;/strong&gt; is a sound that continuously varies its frequency over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exponential curve&lt;/strong&gt;: $y = a^x$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logarithmic curve&lt;/strong&gt;: $y = log_{a}x$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that we hear the &quot;size&quot; of all octave intervals as equal, but that the difference in Hz between two sounds separated by an octave will vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital recording of sound is called &lt;strong&gt;sampling&lt;/strong&gt;, and generates a series of numbers, each of which is a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;: a measurement of the amplitude of the analog signal at a given instant. The process of digitization, in order to work correctly, must be performed at regular intervals; the number of amplitude measurements that are made on a regular basis in one second is defined as the &lt;strong&gt;sampling rate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audio file can be monaural mono, stereo or multichannel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;monaural&lt;/strong&gt; audio file contains a single sequence of numbers that encode its digital waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;stereo&lt;/strong&gt; file, on the other hand, contains two digital sequences that can be converted in parallel, one for the left channel, and right channel, each representing one speaker of a pair, or one headphone channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;multichannel&lt;/strong&gt; file contains a variable number of sequences that can be sent to the same number of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;panning&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the placement of sound within the spatial environment created by two or more channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;power&lt;/strong&gt; of a signal is its total energy, measured at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;intensity&lt;/strong&gt; of a signal which we have generically indicated as a parameter tied to amplitude to this point is the energy transmitted by a sound wave through a given surface area during a given unit of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEFT CHANNEL&lt;/strong&gt;: $Amplitude * \sqrt{1 - X}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIGHT CHANNEL&lt;/strong&gt;: $Amplitude * \sqrt{X}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where center is $X=0.5$, right only is $X=1$, and left only is $X=0$ &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Syntorial?]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is Syntorial and why I am using it.

This is a training tool to help sound designers learn about subtractive synthesis. There are many ways to learn, but in my opinion, this is the best way for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning about music production a few months ago and decided to start instead of hesitating and waiting for that one day. Because I know if I wait any longer, I won&apos;t do it! After reading a few getting started articles. I realized there&apos;s a lot of learning and money involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the learning is sound design and how to use a software synthesizer. A synthesizer is a way to create a sound using midi notes, where each midi note represents a musical note. There are many ways to create a sound, but one common way is subtractive synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning about subtractive synthesis, you would need use a software synthesizer in your digital audio workstation of your choice. It&apos;s common for music producers to buy a license to their favorite software synthesizer, but it&apos;s important to master the concept of subtractive synthesis. Synthesizers are all different in their design and layout. And I found that it&apos;s the filtering algorithm used that makes them sound different and the amplitude envelope used are the constraints to what sounds it can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch many YouTube videos on how to use a software synthesizer of your choice, but most of the videos lack the sound design thought process and only shows you how to recreate a sound. Another alternative is you can buy sounds packs from sound designers. It&apos;s great to use sounds that a professional sound designer created, but there is a knowledge gap of how it was created and why it sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Syntorial comes in. It&apos;s a video game-like training software that focuses on learning how to create a sound by listening. If you can recreate a sound after hearing it, that is when you mastered sound design! It&apos;s a very hard skill to master, but lucky for us this software helps you learn all the fundamentals to subtractive synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s divided into many modules and each module you learn about a section of the synthesizer. I&apos;m still going through each module and I estimate it will take me a long time to master all the modules. As I&apos;m using this software one thing, I realized is that my hearing is getting better. This is all thanks to Syntorial! It makes you use your ears and you will learn to trust it as you learn sound design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this if you want to learn sound design! In my opinion is the best way to learn how to use a software synthesizer and the concepts of subtractive synthesis. After going through the modules, you should be able to understand what each knob and slider does and all the common effects that comes with a software synthesizer. Remember to create a nature sound you have to modulate it to make it feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Hook Theory?]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is Hook Theory and why is it a good tool to use?

I heard about it after watching KSHMR on YouTube, he recommended it as a good learning tool to understand melodies and chords. Why use it? We know that a track is based on a key and scale. And the chords depend on the scale and the melodies depends on the chord progressions. And without a good foundation of music structure and theory, we cannot create something remarkable as an aspiring music producer. Hook Theory provides you with the tools and resources you need to understand music structure and theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hook Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website has many useful resources for music lovers everywhere to use when they want to analyze their favorite songs. We can learn a lot from our favorite songs, the ones you remember and have an emotion connection to. If we take some time looking at their musical structure, we can learn what makes a track sound good. Lucky for us, the creators of Hook Theory created a books series called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HOOK THEORY 1&lt;/code&gt; AND &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HOOK THEORY 2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will you learn in this series? You will understand how to analyze chords and melodies, which are the building blocks of a music structure. Remember you need a good understanding of the fundamentals before you can master any skills. I went through the book series and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about music production like I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the learning from the series that I would like to remember and have a place to reference them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Superscript/Subscript&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic chord in root position.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{6}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic chord in first inversion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{6}_{4}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Basic chord in second inversion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{7}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh chord in root position.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{6}_{5}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh chord in first inversion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{4}_{3}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh chord in second inversion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$^{4}_{2}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh chord in third inversion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way a note is used in a song is determined by its position in the scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The particular major scale that a song happens to use doesn&apos;t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beat 1 &amp;#x26; 3 are consider strong while beat 2 &amp;#x26; 4 are consider weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes in the melody that are played on strong beats are more important than notes played on weak beats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that falls between beats are even less important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note&apos;s position in a measure affects how much importance it has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale degrees in the melody that coincide with the underlying harmony are called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stable scale degrees&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Unstable scale degrees&lt;/code&gt; refer to the scale degrees that are not contained  in the underlying harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When unstable notes are used on weak beats to link two stable scale degrees together, they are called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;passing notes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an unstable scale degree appears on a strong beat at some point the melodic line should resolve to the nearest stable scale degree, above or below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the lowest note or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bass note&lt;/code&gt; is not the root of the chord, we say that the chord is in an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inversion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any time you use a chord that has a function relative to a different home base, you are using what is called a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondary chord&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary chords often create tension that begs for a resolution to a chord that is in the scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A general rule of thumb is that sharped scale degrees have a natural tendency to resolve upward to the nearest scale degree, whereas flatted scale degrees like to resolve downward to the nearest scale degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bass note is the most important note in the chord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more unique scale degrees a chord has, the more complex and dissonant it sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Song energy is a complex mixture of tempo, volume, instrumentation, and harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cadences that trick the listener by going to an unexpected chord are known as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;deceptive cadences&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chord substituted in this way are known as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;borrowed chords&lt;/code&gt;, and the practice of using them is known as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal mixture&lt;/code&gt; since you are mixing chords from two or more different modes in the same progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important chords have been the $\textrm {I}$, $\textrm {IV}$, and $\textrm {V}$ chords, the $\textrm {I}$ chord being home base, the $\textrm {V}$ chord setting up cadences, and the $\textrm {IV}$ playing the versatile role of pre-cadence chord, cadence chord, and bridge between $\textrm {I}$ and other chords in the progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mode are limited in their ability to change the feel of a song, as we&apos;ve learned, they don&apos;t actually introduce any new chords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every mode uses the same set of chords from the major scale, just in different contexts and with a different chord as the home base.&lt;/li&gt;

The harmonic structure of a piece of music is defined by a series of chords. For a musical piece to sound good, the melody should fit within your series of chords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the notes, the intervals within the chord define the type of chord. A basic chord consists of three notes called a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;triad&lt;/code&gt; and the notes are called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;third&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fifth&lt;/code&gt;. The root defines the key of the chord and the type of chord is determined by the middle note - the third. Let&apos;s look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C Major&lt;/code&gt; chord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C Major Chord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can keep adding more thirds as you extend your chords, but remember adding more thirds add more color or flavor to the sound and most of the time seventh are good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more different types of chord and the chart below will give you the formula to them using C as the key. Remember, $\flat$ means lowered a half step and # means raised half-step. The chart should help you know the name of a chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Inversions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing about chord is you can invert them to make them sound a bit different and make them easier to play. To invert a chord, you take the lowest note and move it up one octave. You can continue inverting your chord until your chord is the same but one octave higher, but remember you are changing the bass note each time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learning About Chord Progressions!]]></title><description><![CDATA[Once you understand what a scale and chord is, the next step is to learn about chord progressions.

A chord progression is a series of well-arranged chords that produces a natural sound. We can start by understanding all the chords in a scale. A scale has seven notes, which tells us we can create seven different chords in the scale. To do this, we&apos;ll start with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C Major&lt;/code&gt; scale. To build each chord we will start at the root through our seventh note using our knowledge of minor and major chord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C Major Chords&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created these chords in Ableton, as you can see, we have seven unique chords and the root chord is shown twice first and last. We can name each chord similar to when we named each note in the scale. The naming convention for chords is Roman numerals $\textrm {I}$ through $\textrm {VII}$, where uppercase for major chords and lowercase for minor chords. Additionally, a diminished chord uses the lowercase Roman numeral plus a small circle while an augmented chord uses the uppercase Roman numeral plus a small plus sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Major Chords Roman Numeral Table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Roman Numeral&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {I}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supertonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {ii}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mediant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {iii}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Subdominant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {IV}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dominant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {V}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Submediant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {vi}$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Leading Tone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$\textrm {vii}^\circ$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember a quick and easy way to know if it&apos;s a major or minor chord is counting the semitones between the root and the third. A major chord has a major third which is four semitones away from the root, while a minor chord has a minor third which is 3 semitones away from the root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s look at the relative scale of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C Major&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A Minor&lt;/code&gt; to get an idea of the Roman numeral naming convention for a minor scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the tonic chord for a minor scale is a minor, while the tonic for a major scale is a major chord. You might already guess that both &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C Major&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A Minor&lt;/code&gt; has the same chords, but the order is different! The Tonic of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A Minor&lt;/code&gt; chords is the same as the Submediant of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C Major&lt;/code&gt; chords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the naming convention for chords it&apos;s easier to read and write chord progressions! You can find many chord progressions online, but remember your melody is based off your chord progression and vice versa. I want to end by quickly by talking about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cadence&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cadence is how you end your chord progression. There are two common ways to end your chord, perfect cadence $\textrm {V} - \textrm {I}$ or plagal cadence $\textrm {IV} - \textrm {I}$. Ending your chord progression with a cadence give it a natural ending.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learning About Musical Scale]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is a musical scale and why is it important to know?

A scale is eight successive pitches all within a one octave range. In other words, all scale starts on one note and ends on that same note one octave higher. Each scale is picked to convey an emotion to the listeners. One day I hope to understand each scale, but for now I&apos;m still learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn about scales is using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C major&lt;/code&gt; scale. All the notes in the scale is the white keys and it&apos;s a good one to remember when we think about a major scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I colored all the white keys a shade of red to represent the notes in a scale. In a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C major&lt;/code&gt; scale the root is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; key and we end the scale on the same key but one octave higher. We use a number to represent the notes in the scale, this is known as degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Degrees of a Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Degree&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First / Root&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supertonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mediant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Subdominant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dominant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Submediant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Leading Note&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eighth / Octave&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are seven unique notes in a scale before we hit tonic again! What makes each scale unique is the specific intervals between each degree in the scale. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C major&lt;/code&gt; scale is the best way to remember the intervals for all major scales! Each intervals between each degree can be described using whole and half steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Major Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the intervals for a major scale, we can apply this to any key on the piano. It&apos;s do the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; major scale!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s do the minor scale! But wait there&apos;s three different minor scales to pick from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Types Of Minor Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;natural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;harmonic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;melodic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s do the natural minor scale first and the easiest way to remember this scale is using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A minor&lt;/code&gt; scale.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A minor&lt;/code&gt; scale we can see all the notes in the scale are the white keys just like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C major&lt;/code&gt;. The reason why is because they are relative to each other where all the notes are the same in both scales. The only difference is the tonic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to finding the relative scale of major or minor is first knowing what scale you are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a major scale, the relative natural minor scale would be 9 half-steps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a natural minor scale, the relative major scale would be 3 half-steps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Natural Minor Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the harmonic minor, it&apos;s very similar to the natural minor except the seventh note is raised a half step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Harmonic Minor Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s do the melodic minor, it&apos;s very similar to the natural minor except both the sixth and seventh notes are raised a half step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Melodic Minor Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get past the major and minor scales, there are other combination of intervals in a scale. Since there are 7 degrees in a scale there are 7 different modes. You can think of this as starting on a different degree on the major scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ionian - starting on the tonic on a major scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dorian - starting on the second degree on a major scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tonic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phrygian - starting on the third degree on a major scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Half Steps to Next Note&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Third&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fourth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fifth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sixth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seventh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mixolydian - starting on the fifth degree on a major scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pick a scale, most of the notes in the melody and chords should be within the scale. The four commmonly used modes are major, minor, dorian, and mixolydian.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Mixed In Key?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mixed In Key is a software that DJs around the world use to create their live sets.

It&apos;s a very useful tool that helps find the key and scale of a track along with the energy level. In this post I will go over what I learned from using this software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Harmonic Mixing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the website states is used for harmonic mixing. But what is harmonic mixing? Well it has something to do with music theory and a sound&apos;s harmonic series. I&apos;ll try and explain this using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amaj&lt;/code&gt; chord.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amaj&lt;/code&gt; chord is made up of three keys, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C#&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;. The fundamental frequency of that chord is the lowest frequency which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; also known as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. If you look at a frequencies chart for piano notes you can see all the frequencies for each key. Let&apos;s use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; above middle &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; key because it has a easy to remember frequency of 440 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s something in music theory called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;perfect interval&lt;/code&gt;, these intervals are fourths, fifths, and octaves. It is all based off of their frequency&apos;s ratio compared to the fundamental frequency. For example, a perfect octave has a ratio of 2:1, so a perfect octave for our fundamental frequency 400Hz is 880 Hz. That&apos;s the next &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; key on the piano keyboard! The math isn&apos;t important, but for the perfect fourth has a ratio of 4:3 and a perfect fifth has a ratio of 3:2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amaj&lt;/code&gt; chord or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt; chord you will notice that the perfect fifth is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; while our root is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. Based on the frequency ratio we know when we play &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; together it sounds good because the frequency is very similar! What about the key between them? The third interval determines if the chord is major or minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know about perfect intervals. Let&apos;s quickly talk about a scale of a track. We know that a minor scale creates mellow melodies and a major scale creates happy melodies, this is a very generalize way to describe minor and major scales. The most important takeaway is a scale determines the notes played in the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now harmonic mixing is based off of the perfect interval, but focuses on the perfect fifth! What do you mean it&apos;s based off the perfect fifth? Let&apos;s take a look on how to use their Camelot Wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the wheel, let&apos;s imagine we are playing a track that has a key of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and is in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;minor&lt;/code&gt; scale as known as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt;. It states we could mix it with another track that is in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Emin&lt;/code&gt;/Up, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Dmin&lt;/code&gt;/Down, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt;/Same, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmaj&lt;/code&gt;/Same. What does Up, Down, and Same mean? Up means up a fifth, Down means down a fifth, and Same means same scale or relative scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that every minor scale has a relative major scale and vice versa. In our case, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt; has a relative major scale &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmaj&lt;/code&gt;. Ok, now let&apos;s understand what up a fifth means, the wheel states we can go from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Emin&lt;/code&gt;. Let&apos;s use the piano keyboard to visualize this.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned earlier that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; was the perfect fifth of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;! We know that the frequency ratio is 3:2 and the frequency are very similar. That means if we mix a track from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Amin&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Emin&lt;/code&gt;, people can barely tell the difference or that a change happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the biggest takeaway from this? As we move clockwise on the wheel, we are going up a perfect fifth from the root. And we know that the perfect fifth for both minor and major scales is 7 half-steps up from the root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s test this theory out using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; as our root and the scale does not matter!&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, we are going up but what does that mean? Going up means we are counting the keys above our root; these keys has higher frequencies and a higher pitch. Now let&apos;s start counting to 7 starting with key next to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; which is the black key called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C#&lt;/code&gt;. Counting all the half-steps until we hit 7, will be our perfect fifth! The perfect fifth for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; and it matches with the wheel. Going clockwise we can see &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmin&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gmin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmaj&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gmaj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know what up a fifth means! Let&apos;s focus on what down a fifth means! But let&apos;s take some time to think about this! Going down a fifth is like the opposite of going up a fifth... In other words, using keyboard above, down a fifth for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; which was previous known as our perfect fifth but we are naming it our root is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;. This matches what the wheel state going counter clockwise &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gmin&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gmaj&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cmaj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait there&apos;s a pattern here! Going up a fifth means going up 7 half-steps and going down a fifth means going down 7 half-steps from the root. Are you telling me if I know how to count to 7 than I know how to mix my tracks? Yes! Good thing we have 10 fingers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s understand how to use this chart without making me think about the number 7!&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this Camelot wheel help determine what track I will play next. There is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt;. The number represent all possible notes on a piano and the letter represent if the scale is a minor &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or major &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. We know there are 12 possible piano notes before we start repeating the same notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how do we use this chart? The Mixed In Key software will find the key and scale of all your tracks and give it a number and letter. Now you can pick your next track based off its number and letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say we are playing a track that is label &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/code&gt; we have many options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can play another track that is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/code&gt; and continue playing the same key and scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can change the scale and play &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1B&lt;/code&gt; track and continue playing the same key but in a major scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can go up a fifth and play &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2A&lt;/code&gt; track and play a different key but same scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can go down a fifth and play &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12A&lt;/code&gt; track and play a different key but same scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other options based on perfect intervals like the perfect fourths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having these labels makes it easy for DJs to mix a track in without looking at the Camelot chart or counting to 7!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed In Key also determines the energy level of your track for you! We all know tracks emits different energy levels, some songs make you sad, happy, want to dance, and wants to put your hands in the air! But how do we determine the energy level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drums form the DNA strands of dance music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good way is to determine what type of kick is used in the track. The kick guides everyone on the dance floor and knowing the shape of the kick and the loudness of the track, we can determine the energy level. Mixed In Key does this all for us using a scale from 1 to 10!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy Level 1, 2, 3, &amp;#x26; 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are consider chillout and lounge music, it&apos;s hard to dance to them but can be played in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy Level 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where people start dancing but are not the mainstream music you hear in clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy Level 6 &amp;#x26; 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level there&apos;s a lot of energy on the dance floor for people to start dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy 8 &amp;#x26; 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play a song at this energy level will make people raise their hands in the air! Use this power wisely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Level 10 is never played, because it&apos;s TOO LOUD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed In Key gives you all the tools DJs needs to create a live set. It&apos;s important to create an emotion roller coaster because that&apos;s what life is. It&apos;s just one big roller coaster ride!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Add MathJax To Your Gatsby Website]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to write beautiful math equations on your website and you're using Gatsby.

This is the tutorial for you! In this blog post I will show how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you would need to download the required Gatsby plugins that you can find in their plugin&apos;s library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install --save gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-remark-mathjax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After downloading the required dependencies, you need to include the plugin in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-config.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// in your gatsby-config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;gatsby-transformer-remark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-mathjax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that it&apos;s inside your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-transformer-remark&lt;/code&gt; plugin, it&apos;s used along with our markdown plugin. You probably think that is all you have to do to get beautiful math equations on your web page... That was what I thought after going through this process on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-mathjax&lt;/code&gt; plugin documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there&apos;s a few more steps before we can write the quadratic formula, we all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to download the MathJax library, there are a few ways to do this. I prefer using the CDN which stands for Content Delivery Network. This allows us to download files from the web using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag in our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s get to it! If you went through the Gatsby tutorial, you would know we use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-helmet&lt;/code&gt; to add scripts into our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element. To add our CDN script we will be using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; property that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Helmet&lt;/code&gt; component has. This property takes in an array of scripts, so let&apos;s define our array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; scripts &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text/x-mathjax-config&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
    window.MathJax.Hub.Config({
    extensions: [&quot;tex2jax.js&quot;],
    jax: [&quot;input/TeX&quot;, &quot;output/HTML-CSS&quot;],
    tex2jax: {
      inlineMath: [ [&apos;$&apos;,&apos;$&apos;], [&quot;\\(&quot;,&quot;\\)&quot;] ],
      displayMath: [ [&apos;$$&apos;,&apos;$$&apos;], [&quot;\\[&quot;,&quot;\\]&quot;] ],
      processEscapes: true,
      tex2jax: {preview: &quot;none&quot;}
    },
    &quot;HTML-CSS&quot;: { availableFonts: [&quot;TeX&quot;] },
    messageStyle: &quot;none&quot;
  });&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;text/javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first element in the array is our MathJax configuration settings which allow us to define our delimiter for inline and display mode. As you can see there are two ways to generate our math equation, I will demonstrate it later in this blog. The next and last element is the CDN link to download a minified MathJax file. We need the library to know how to replace our TeX/LaTeX syntax with web fonts or SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now time to add this to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Helmet&lt;/code&gt; component!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Helmet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{scripts}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;Helmet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok now we have everything we need to write our math equation! However, Gatsby is a single page application so when we render our markdown we have to parse our LaTex syntax. To do this we need to tell our React component to invoke MathJax once the markdown is loaded using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook. We would add this hook to the React component that renders our markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;MathJax &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;MathJax&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Hub&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Typeset&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;MathJax&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Hub&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Displaying Beautiful Mathematical Equations!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of equations you can create using the TeX/LaTeX syntax: ones occur within a paragraph inline and the other for displaying the equation in a larger format. For the inline format we will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; and for the display mode we will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt;. Now let&apos;s write the quadratic formula!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to write math equations on your Gatsby website!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[THE MIXING ENGINEER'S HANDBOOK Fourth Edition]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mixing Approach Determine the Direction of the Song Develop the Groove Find the Most Important Element and Emphasize It.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the Direction of the Song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop the Groove&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the Most Important Element and Emphasize It.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rule For Arrangements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the number of elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything in its own frequency range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Goals of Equalization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make an instrument sound clearer and more defined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make the instrument or mix bigger and larger than life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make all the elements of a mix fit together better by putting each instrument in its own predominate frequency range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tremolo is a cyclic variation in volume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vibrato changes the pitch of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to time the delay to the track in order for it to pulse with the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1/4\,Note = (60\,Sec\,/\,BPM) * 1000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$Dotted\,Value = Delay\,Time * 1.5$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something remarkable is worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing right into your product or service. Understand that if your offering itself isn&apos;t remarkable it&apos;s invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s cheaper to keep an old customer than it is to get a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CREATE REMARKABLE PRODUCT THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE SEEK OUT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you break through to the mainstream is to target a niche instead of a huge market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT IS USELESS TO ADVERTISE TO ANYONE EXCEPT INTERESTED SNEEZERS WITH INFLUENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cow is so rare because people are afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We face two choices: to be invisible, anonymous, uncriticized, and safe, or to take a chance at greatness, uniqueness, and the Cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being safe is risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the market niche first, and then make the remarkable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path to lifetime job security is to be remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turning Pro - Tap Your Inner Power and Create Your Life's Work]]></title><description><![CDATA[When craft, dedication, and professionalism come together, the result can be astonishing.

&lt;p&gt;What ails us is that we are living our lives as amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning pro is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we get when we turn pro is, we find our power. We find our will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and to live out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when we&apos;re terrified of embracing our true calling, we&apos;ll pursue a shadow calling instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shadow career is a metaphor for our real career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amateur life is our youth. It&apos;s our hero&apos;s journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a pro, in the end, is nothing grander than growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow life is the life of the amateur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human being is a creature of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we&apos;re living as amateurs, we&apos;re running away from our calling - meaning our work, our destiny, the obligation to become our truest and highest selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addiction becomes the shadow version, the evil twin of our calling to service or to art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addictions and shadow careers are messages in a bottle from our unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance hates two qualities above all others: concentration and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entity we&apos;re seeking union with is ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you and I are really seeking is our own voice, our own truth, our own authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habits and addictions of the amateur are conscious or unconscious self-inflicted wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amateur fears that if he turns pro and lives out his calling, he will have to live up to who he really is and what he is truly capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amateur fears, above all else, becoming and being seen and judged as himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his heart, the amateur knows he&apos;s hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans they all start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The force that can save the amateur is awareness, particularly self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear of self-definition is what keeps an amateur an amateur and what keeps an addict and addict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we turn pro, we stop running from our fears. We turn around and face them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning pro changes how we spend our time and with whom we spend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning pro is a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional habits and qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional shows up every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional stays on the job all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional is committed over the long haul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the professional, the stakes are high and real&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the professional is patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional seeks order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional demystifies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional acts in the face of fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional accepts no excuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional plays it as it lays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional is prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional does not show off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional does not hesitate to ask for help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional does not take failure or success personally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional does not identify with his or her instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional endures adversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional self-validates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional reinvents herself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professional is recognized by other professionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional displays courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pro works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional is happy to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional refuses to be iconized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pro will share his wisdom with other professionals - or with amateurs who are committed to becoming professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do the work for itself alone, it turns into a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know what we have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we raise our game aesthetically, we elevate if morally and spiritually as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the enterprise and the sacrifice are all about the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Creative Habit - Learn It and Use It For Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[the task of starting with nothing and working your way towards creating something whole and beautiful and satisfying.

&lt;p&gt;The blank space can be humbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, as the daily routines become second nature, discipline morphs into habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be creative, you have to know how to prepare to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes skill to bring something you&apos;ve imagined into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If art is the bridge between what you see in your mind and what the world sees, then skill is how you build that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning something into a ritual eliminates the question, why am I doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making the start of the sequence automatic, they replace doubt and fear with comfort and routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They arm us with confidence and self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the unknown is a fearful place, and anything new is a step into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have selected the environment that works for you, developed the start-up ritual that impels you forward every day, faced down your fears, and put your distractions in their proper place, you have cleared the first hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build up your tolerance for solitude, you need a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitude is an unavoidable part of creativity. Self-reliance is a happy by-product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing is better than not doing, and if you do something badly, you&apos;ll learn to do it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have strands of creative code hard-wired into our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity is more about taking the facts, fictions, and feelings we store away and finding new ways to connect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphor is the lifeblood of all art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphor is our vocabulary for connecting what we&apos;re experiencing now with which we have experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all art is metaphor, then all art begins with memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills get imprinted through the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of muscle memory gives you a path toward genuine creation through simple re-creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a goal and put it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas are all around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the little ideas, there are no big ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be habitually creative, you have to know how to prepare to be creative, but good planning alone won&apos;t make your efforts successful; it&apos;s only after you let go of your plans that you can breathe life into your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in creative endeavors luck is a skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ticking clock is our friend if it gets us moving with urgency and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every work of art needs a spine - an underlying theme, a motive for coming into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills is how you close the gap between what you can see in your mind&apos;s eye and what you can produce; the more skill you have, the more sophisticated and accomplished your ideas can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to do for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence is a trait that has to be earned honestly and refreshed constantly; you have to work as hard to protect your skills as you did to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect practice makes perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inexperience erases fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The thing is to become a master and in your old age to acquire the courage to do what children did when they know nothing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skills you&apos;ve developed suffuse all aspects of your ability to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every creative person has to learn to deal with failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private failure are great. The more you fail in private the less you will fail in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing, and learning from it, is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creativity has become your habit; when you&apos;ve learned to manage time, resources, expectations, and the demands of others; when you understand the value and place of validation, continuity, and purity of purpose - then you&apos;re on the way to an artist&apos;s ultimate goal: the achievement of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steal Like an Artist - 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative]]></title><description><![CDATA[STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST.

&lt;p&gt;Figure out what&apos;s worth stealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what&apos;s &quot;good&quot; and what&apos;s &quot;bad&quot; - there&apos;s only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that&apos;s not worth stealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only art I&apos;ll ever study is stuff that I can steal from.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All creative work builds on what came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DON&apos;T WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TO GET STARTED.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&apos;s the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ready start making stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just show up to do their thing. Every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake it til you make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn by copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying is about reverse-engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them. Adding something to the world that only you can add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WRITE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;write what you like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use - do the work you want to see done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;USE YOUR HANDS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to move, to feel like we-re making something with our bodies, not just our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to find a way to bring your body into your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SIDE PROJECTS AND HOBBIES ART IMPORTANT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice productive procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time to mess around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DO GOOD WORK AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you want attention only after you&apos;re doing really good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;re unknown, there&apos;s nothing to distract you from getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do good work and share it with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GEOGRAPHY IS NO LONGER OUR MASTER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t have to live anywhere other than the place you are to start connecting with the world you want to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need is a little space and a little time - a place to work, and some time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we choose to live still has a huge impact on the work we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE NICE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s only one rule I know of: You&apos;ve got to be kind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best way to get approval is to not need it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t go looking for validation from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE BORING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of energy to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about money as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inertia is the death of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the work every day, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work gets done in the time available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;marry well&quot;. Who you marry is the most important decision you&apos;ll ever make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CREATIVITY IS SUBTRACTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what&apos;s really important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we respond to in any work of art is the artist&apos;s struggle against his or her limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must embrace your limitations and keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity isn&apos;t just the things we choose to put in, it&apos;s the things we choose to leave out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shortcuts to Hit Songwriting - 126 Proven Techniques for Writing Songs that Sell]]></title><description><![CDATA[A song is all about - an emotional reaction to the melody, lyrics, and chords.

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s your message, your story, your emotions that are driving the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be the master of your craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft is what helps you reach your audience but, for a song to be fulfilling for you as an artist, for you to love what you do, want to keep doing it, and grow while you do it, inspiration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse lyrics give the listener information. The lyrics change in each verse adding to the listener&apos;s understanding of the situation and emotional theme. The chord progression and melody remain the same in each verse with small variations in the melody to accommodate lyric change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chorus is the high point of a contemporary song. The chorus melody is catchy and memorable; the lyrics sum up and focus the overall theme laid out in the verse. The melody and lyric remain the same each time the chorus is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hook is the most memorable line in your song. It often includes the title. It grabs attention and haul the listener into the song. It&apos;s the line that listener will remember long after the song is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge occurs about two-thirds of the way into the song, after we&apos;ve heard the verse or verse and chorus a couple of times. The bridge provides variety and relief from the now familiar verse and chorus melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-chorus occurs at the end of a verse and provides a build up to the chorus. It adds to the intensity of the song, creating a sense of anticipation that gives us a greater sense of emotional release when we get to the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each change in volume level will attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repetition averts chaos and creates a recognizable pattern for listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do it, do it again, go away, and then come back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A verse can be from eight bars to sixteen bars. Pre-chorus range from four to eight bars. Chorus can be anywhere from eight bars up to fourteen or sixteen bars long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one song section ends and another begins, it creates a transition point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of hit songs are about love relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most titles are one to five words in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feature a character called &quot;you&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to tell you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to vocalize your lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hit songs work hard to ensure the listener knows where Beat 1 is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word phrase is simply a group of words that expresses an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a melodic phrase is simply a group of notes that expresses a musical idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak, we use pitch, rhythm, pace, and volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the engine that drives the emotional enjoyment of music is the melodic interplay of tension and release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beat 1 and Beat 3 are called strong beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beat 2 and Beat 4 are called weak beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An upbeat is a beat between your four beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repetition and organization of rhythm patterns make the melody easy to remember, the changes in pitch and lyrics keep it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;leading chords&quot; want to keep moving and lead you somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;home chords&quot; want to stay where they are and not go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only talent you really need to have is the ability to recognize emotional truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Art Of Mixing Third Edition]]></title><description><![CDATA[Thirteen Aspects of a Recorded Piece of Music Concept Intention Melody Rhythm Harmony Lyrics Density of Arrangement Instrumentation Song…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-art-of-mixing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-art-of-mixing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Thirteen Aspects of a Recorded Piece of Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Concept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhythm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harmony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Density of Arrangement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Song Structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance pitch, timing, technique, dynamics, and greatness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality of the Equipment and the Recording&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We relate to sound in two ways: we feel and hear the physical sound waves that come out of the speakers, and we imagine the apparent placement of sounds between the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sound can be moved around in the space between the speakers by changing the volume, panning, and pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louder sounds are larger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High frequency sounds are smaller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a delay longer than 30 ms, you hear two signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placing reverb in a mix is like placing the sound of a room in the space between the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of mixing is the appropriate and creative placement and movement of these sound images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colors can be assigned to specific frequency ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before you begin, it is good to know where you are going.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t touch a knob until you know where you are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mix should be appropriate: appropriate for the style of music, appropriate for the song and all of its details, and appropriate for the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each style of music has developed its own traditions as to how it is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to simply listen to what each one of the thirteen aspects in the song is telling you to do in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must give total respect and consideration to every single idea that someone comes up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound creators range from acoustic to electric instruments, from voice to synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound routers route sound from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage device stores sound or MIDI information and play it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound transducers take one form of energy and change it into another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three components to sound: volume or amplitude, frequency, and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume faders control the volume of each sound in the mix, including effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparent volume of a sound in a mix is based on two main things, the fader level and waveform, and another minor one, the Fletcher/Munson Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fletcher/Munson Curve says human hearing process is that we don&apos;t hear all frequencies at the same volume - especially those at low volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compression and limiting are volume functions; their main purpose is to turn the volume down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiter stops the volume from getting any louder than the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compressor allows the volume to get a bit louder than the threshold based on a ratio, or percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;noise gate drops the volume when falls below the threshold, use to get rid of noise, bleed, and to shorten the duration of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EQ is a change in the volume of a particular frequency of a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term timbre refers to different sound qualities or tonalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;panning is a function of left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echo is a delay time &gt; 100 ms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slap is a delay time between 60 - 100 ms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling is a delay time between 30 - 60 ms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fattening is a delay time between 1 - 30 ms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverb is hundreds and hundreds of delays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every mix in the world is created with the same four tools: volume faders, panning, equalization, and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the primary functions of a compressor/limiter is the to make a sound more present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-based effects, such as delay, flanging, chorusing, phasing, and reverb, all add more sounds to the mix, filling out the space between the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the volume of any sound in a mix is always, based on the volume of the sounds that came before it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love]]></title><description><![CDATA["Follow your passion is dangerous advice."

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating work you love, following your passion is not particularly useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the importance of ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become so good that they can&apos;t ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RULE #1 Don&apos;t Follow Your Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passion Hypothesis: The key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what you&apos;re passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that&apos;s the hardest phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compelling careers often have complete origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career Passions Are Rare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion Takes Time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A job is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that&apos;s an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion is a side effect of Mastery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-Determination Theory SDT tells us that motivation requires three basic psychological needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competence&lt;/strong&gt;: the feeling that you are good at what you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relatedness&lt;/strong&gt;: the feeling of connection to other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion hypothesis is not just wrong, it&apos;s also dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RULE #2 Be So Good They Can&apos;t Ignore You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you&apos;re producing at your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the passion mindset, a focus on what value our job offers you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Be so good they can&apos;t ignore you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;creating something meaningful and then presenting it to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of what type of work you do, the craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People thrive by focusing on the question of who they really are - and connecting that to work that they truly love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you&apos;ll build a compelling career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you adopt the craftsman mindset first and then the passion follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traits that define great work: Creativity, Impact, and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they can&apos;t ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RULE #3 Turn Down a Promotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;control over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work, you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to get good before you can expect good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increase their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control that&apos;s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you&apos;ve become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A leader needs the guts to stand alone and look ridiculous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do what people are willing to pay for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you&apos;re aiming to be valuable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RULE #4 Think Small, Act Big&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using small and achievable projects - little bets - to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;career capital is necessary to identify a good mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The world is full of boring stuff - brown cows - which is why so few people pay attention... A purple cow... now that would stand out. Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tribe - On Homecoming and Belonging]]></title><description><![CDATA[Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.

&lt;p&gt;First agriculture, and then industry, changed two fundamental things about the human experience. The accumulation of personal property allowed people to make more and more individualistic choices about their lives, and those choices unavoidably diminished group effort toward a common good. And as society modernized, people found themselves able to live independently from any communal group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor people are forced to share their time and resources more than wealthy people are, and as a result they live in closer communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial independence can lead to isolation and isolation can put people at a greatly increased risk of depression and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory: that human beings needs three basic things in order to be content: they need to feel compentent at what they do: they need to feel authentic in their lives; and they need to feel connected to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;An earthquake achieves what the law promises but does not in practice maintain. The equality of all men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;when people are actively enaged in a cause their lives have more purpose... with a resulting improvement in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;war makes you an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War can inspire ancient human virtues of courage, loyalty, and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;definition of community of tribe would be the group of people that you would both help feed and help defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you want to make a society work, then you don&apos;t keep underscoring the places where you&apos;re different - you underscore your shared humanity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting in a tribal way simply means being willing to make a substantive sacrifice for your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True leadership require powerful people to put themselves last.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On The Shortness Of Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[We are born for a brief span of life. "life is short, art is long." It is not that we have short space of time, but that we waste much of it…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/on-the-shortness-of-life/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/on-the-shortness-of-life/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We are born for a brief span of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;life is short, art is long.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that we have short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is - the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and - what will perhaps make you wonder more - it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing - nay, of almost no value at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postponement is the greatest waste of life; it deprives them of each day as it comes, it snatches from them the present by promising something hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest hindrance to loving is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why are you idle? Unless you seize the day, it flees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is divided into three periods - that which has been, that which is, that which will be. Of these the present time is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes his life long by combining all times into one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Laws Of Human Nature]]></title><description><![CDATA[We tend to think of our behavior as largely conscious and willed, but in reality, we are subject to forces from deep within us that drive…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-laws-of-human-nature/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-laws-of-human-nature/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of our behavior as largely conscious and willed, but in reality, we are subject to forces from deep within us that drive our behavior and that operate below the level of our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human nature stems from the particular wiring of our brains, the configuration of our nervous system, and the way we humans process emotions, all of which developed and emerged over the course of the five million years or so of our evolution as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human nature is stronger than any individual, than any institution or technological invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Laws will work to transform you into a calmer and more strategic observer of people, helping to free you from all the emotional drama that needlessly drains you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Laws will make you a master interpreter of the cues that people continually emit, giving you a much greater ability to judge their character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often appears out of character is actually more of their true character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the Laws will empower you to take on and outthink the toxic types who inevitably cross your path and who tend to cause long-term emotional damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the Laws will teach you the true levers for motivating and influencing people, making your path in life that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the Laws will make you realize how deeply the force of human nature operate within you, giving you the power to alter your own negative patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, the Laws will transform you into a more empathetic individual, creating deeper and more satisfying bonds with the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Laws will alter how you see your own potential, making you aware of a higher, ideal self within you that you will want to bring out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through practice you will emerge a master of the art, able to thwart the worst that other people can throw at you and to mold yourself into a more rational, self-aware, and productive individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Master Your Emotional Self&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the human mind has to worship something, has to have its attention directed to something it values above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone, you think you are rational, but you are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to learn from experience when we are not looking inward, at the true causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nobody is exempt from the irresistible effect of emotions on the mind, not even the wisest among us; and to some extent irrationality is a function of the structure of our brains and is wired into our very nature by the way we process emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are continually affecting our thought processes and decisions, below the level of our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationality and ethical qualities must be achieved through awareness and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whenever you experience unusual gains or losses, that is precisely the time to step back and counterbalance them with some necessary pessimism or optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consider your reasoning power, your ability to think for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transform Self-love into Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through the quality of attention, we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we must be honest about our own nature and not deny that we are all narcissists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are all on the spectrum of self-absorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empathic attitude: Empathy is more than anything a state of mind, a different way of relating to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral Empathy: Empathy is an instrument of emotional attunement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytic Empathy: The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner so deeply is that you have a lot of information about their tastes, values, and family background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empathic skill: Becoming empathetic involves a process, like anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more people you interact with on the flesh, the better you will get at this. And the greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What make us develop these empathic powers is necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;realize you have a remarkable social tool that you are not cultivating, pay deeper attention to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;See Through People&apos;s Masks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the mind and the body operate together, in ways we are hardly aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are often used as a cover-up, a way to conceal what is really going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nonverbal communication cannot be experienced simply through thinking and translating thoughts into words but must be felt physically as one engages with the facial expressions or looked positions of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the preeminent social animal on the planet, depending on our ability to communicate with others for our survival and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must recognize your state of self-absorption and have little you actually observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans are consummate actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All the World&apos;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that everything people do is a sign of some sort; there is no such thing as a gesture that does not communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that people are generally trying to present the best possible front to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;three categories of the most important cues to observe and identify are dislike / like, dominance / submission, and deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater whomever they please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans are by nature quite gullible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is truly authentic doesn&apos;t need to play a role in life, we think, but can simply be him - or herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master the nonverbal cues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a method actor. In method acting you train yourself to be able to display the proper emotions on command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adapt to your audience, know your audience and shape your nonverbal cues to their style and taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the proper first impression, looking people in the eye in these first encounters can do wonders for lowering their natural resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use dramatic effects, this involves mastering the art of presence / absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project saintly qualities, you want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Determine the Strength of People&apos;s Characters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are poorly equipped to gauge the character of the people we deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Train yourself to ignore the front that people display, the myth that surrounds them, and plumb their depths for signs of their characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person of strong character is like gold - rare but invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character is something that is so deeply ingrained or stamped within us that it compels us to act in certain ways, beyond our awareness and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must come to understand your own character, examining as best you can the elements in your past that have gone into forming it, and the patterns, mostly negative, that you can see recurring in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must develop your skills in reading the character of the people you deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to observe people&apos;s character - as seen in their actions and patterns - is absolutely critical social skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people never do something just once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool that repeats his folly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you want to test a man&apos;s character, give him power.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;introverts and extroverts do not naturally understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weak character will neutralize all of the other possible good qualities a person might possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of real strength are as rare as gold, and if you find them, you should respond as if you had discovered a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have a set character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Become an Elusive Object of Desire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to think of the audience first and to strategize how to play on their imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;surround yourself in an aura of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were desirable because someone else desired them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on what you want and covet in the world, you must train yourself to focus on others, on their repressed desires and unmet fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do not want truth and honesty; they want their imaginations to be stimulated and to be taken beyond their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grass-is-always-greener syndrome - if we get too close to the grass to that new object, we see that it is not really so green after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;induction, how something positive generates a contrasting negative image in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality can be quite harsh and is full of limits and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our imagination is essentially limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We become creatures who are continually prone to imagining something better than present circumstances and feeling some pleasure in the release from reality that our imagination brings us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know how and when to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more active our imagination becomes, the greater the pleasure we derive from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create rivalries of desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is not possession but desire that secretly impels people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our path must always be toward greater awareness of our nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you really must covet is a deeper relationship to reality, which will bring you calmness, focus, and practical powers to alter what it is possible to alter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elevate Your Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people lost the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans tend to live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the present moment we lack perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the passage of time, we gain more information and see more of the truth; what was invisible to us in the present now becomes visible in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is the greatest teacher of them all, the revealer of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We force ourselves to look at the overall context of the event, not just what immediately grabs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process that involves distance from the present, a deeper look at the source of problems, a wider perspective on the overall context of the situation, and a look further into the future - including the consequences of our actions and our own long-term priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term thinking is hardwired into our system; we are built to respond to what is immediate and to seek out instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid deep contact with those whose time frame is narrow, who are in continual react mode, and strive to associate with those with an expanded awareness of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alarmed by something in the present, we grab for a solution without thinking deeply about the context, the root of the problem, the possible unintended consequences that might ensure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win through your actions, not your words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must develop patience, which is like a muscle that requires training and repetition to make it strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with issues that are important, we must have a clear sense of our long-term goals and how to attain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to have faith that time will eventually prove us right and to maintain our resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the greater potential of the human animal, is to widen your relationship to time as much as possible, and slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is your great teacher and master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think deeply about your long-term goals, they are not vague dreams but concrete objectives, and you have mapped out a path to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soften People&apos;s Resistance by Confirming Their Soft-opinion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the focus on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this feeling of validation is the golden key that will unlock people&apos;s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must discover the power that we can possess by giving people the validation they crave and lowering their defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have a perception about themselves that we shall call their self-opinion, what matters is how people perceive their own character and worthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am autonomous, acting of my own free will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am intelligent in my own way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am basically good and decent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our self-opinion is primary; it determines so much of our thinking and our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instill in people a feeling of inner security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transform yourself into a deep listener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are more interested in our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences than in those of the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infect people with the proper mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not judge other people; you accept them as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirm their self-opinion: Autonomy, Intelligence, Goodness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allay their insecurities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use people&apos;s resistance and stubbornness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people often won&apos;t do what others ask them to do, because they simple want to assert their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our intelligence depends on the ability to absorb the lessons and ideas of those who are older and wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change Your Circumstances by Changing Your Attitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no more bowing and apologizing to people; no more complaining and blaming; no more disorderly living and wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom that we all experienced came from a choice, a different way of looking at the world, a change in attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By accepting people, by understanding and it possible even loving them for their human nature, we can liberate our minds from obsessive and pretty emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our work and through getting what we need on our own, without depending on others, we can stand tall and realize our potential as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The greatest discovery of my generation is the fact that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No two people see or experience the world in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world simply exists as it is - things or events are not good or bad, right or wrong, ugly or beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shape much of the reality that we perceive, dictated by our moods and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us sees the world through a particular lens that colors and shapes our perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we love or admire someone, we tend to internalize a part of their presence, and they shape how we see the world in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we must understand about the attitude is not only how it colors our perceptions but also how it actively determines what happens to us in life - our health, our relations with people, and our success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must become aware of your own attitude and how it slants your perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must not only be aware of the role of your attitude, but also believe in its supreme power to alter your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See yourself as an explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although adversity and pain are generally beyond your control, you have the power to determine your response and the fate that comes from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must accept diversity and that fact that people are what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soul is not the mind or the body but rather the overall spirit we embody, our way of experiencing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You accept and embrace uncertainty and the unexpected as valuable qualities of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confront Your Dark Side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have crafted a public persona that accentuates your strengths and conceals your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your task as a student of human nature is to recognize and examine the dark side of your character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shadow consists of all the qualities people try to deny about themselves and repress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shadow lies buried deep within, but it becomes disturbed and active in moments of stress, or when deep wounds and insecurities are triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only way that something unpleasant or uncomfortable in our unconscious mind is through active denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people are drunk and behave differently, often it is not the alcohol that is speaking but the Shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;behind any vehement hatred is often a secret and very unpalatable envy of the hated person or people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See our Shadow in action and become more self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through such self-knowledge we can find a way to integrate the dark side into our consciousness productively and creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the emphatic trait generally rests on top of the opposite trait, distracting and concealing it from public view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laws of human nature dictate, the deeper the repression, the greater the volatility of the Shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are completely drawn to the authentic types and unconsciously repulsed by their opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can often see our Shadow better than we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal - not only complete acceptance of the Shadow but the desire to integrate it into your present personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conscious thinking, we depend on is quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pay a greater price for being so nice and deferential than for consciously showing your Shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust your native genius and the ideas you have come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beware the Fragile Ego&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is socially toxic to display envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;envy is a painful emotion, an admission of our own inferiority, something rather unbearable for us humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for enviers to feel entitled to take harmful action, they must create a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy occurs most commonly and painfully among friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people who feel envy in the first place are often motivated to become our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any success or increase in attention that we experience will cause greater leakage of their true feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pain inflicted by one envier friend can resonate and poison you for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the human emotions, none is trickier or more elusive than envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We almost never directly express the envy we are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your task as a student of human nature is to transform yourself into a master decoder of envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fact of social life that there are always people who are superior to us in wealth, intelligence, likability, and other qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this in three ways: by learning the signs of envy that manage to leak through, by being aware of the types of people who are more prone to acting on envy, and by understanding the circumstances and actions that might trigger active envy in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are envious cannot help feeling some glee when they hear of the bad luck of those they envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;envying types secretly loathe those who are immune to feeling envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the power you have to short-circuit envy by placing attention on other people instead of yourself and engaging with them on a meaningful level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all compare ourselves with others; we all feel unsettled by those who are superior in some area that we esteem; and we all react to this by feeling some form of envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know You Limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the tendency is to blame others for every failure or setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans possess a weakness that is latent in us all and will push us into the delusional process without our ever being aware of the dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are rarely aware of your own grandiosity because by its nature it alters your perception of reality and make it hard to have an accurate assessment of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may claim they are interested in the work itself or in contributing to humanity, but often deep down what is really motivating them is the desire to have attention, to have their high self-opinion confirmed by others who admire them, to feel powerful and inflated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it would be best for you to accept your limitations and work with that you have, rather than fantasize about godlike powers you can never attain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are simply one person among many in the world, and not naturally superior to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being realistic and pragmatic is what makes us humans so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In becoming more realistic, you are simply becoming more human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must admit to yourself that you do want to feel important and be the center of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to get int the habit of focusing deeply and completely on a single project or problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your goal is to see continual improvement in your skill level, which will certainly come from the depth of your focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your project begins with an idea, and as you try to hone this idea, you let your imagination take flight, being open to various possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reconnect to the Masculine or Feminine Within You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all born as complete beings, with many sides to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to play certain roles and live up to certain expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conform to the expected roles of our culture and time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in love, we become prey to emotions we cannot control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By relating more to the natural feminine or masculine parts within you, you will unleash energy that has been repressed; your mind will recover its natural fluidity, you will understand and relate better to those of the opposite sex; and by ridding yourself of the defensiveness you have in relation to your gender role, you will feel secure in who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When men make mistakes, they tend to look outward and find other people or circumstances to blame. For women, it is the opposite; they tend to blame themselves and look inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakness comes from the inability to ask questions and to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are compelled by nature to want to move closer to what is feminine or masculine, in the form of an attraction to another person. But if we are wise, we realize we are equally compelled to do so inwardly. For centuries men have looked to women as muses’ sources of inspiration. The truth is that the muse, for both genders, lies within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advance with a Sense of Purpose - The Law of Aimlessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to present a front to the world that is consistent and mature, but we know inside that we are subject to many different moods and wear many different faces, depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wander through life, never quite reaching the goals that we feel are so important to us, or realizing our potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a responsibility to set out to discover what we are made for, to discover our life&apos;s work, to discover what we are called to do. And after we discover that, we should set out to do it with all the strength and all of the power that we can muster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this &quot;life&apos;s work&quot; something that speaks to you from within - a voice it directs you toward activities and goals that mesh with your nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us want to believe that there is some purpose and meaning to our life, that we are connected to something larger than ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By our nature we humans crave a sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each human individual is radically unique. This uniqueness is inscribed in us in three ways - the one-of-a-kind configuration of our DNA, the particular way our brains are wired, and our experiences as we go through life, experiences that are unlike any other&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sense of purpose, we feel much less insecure and are less prone to depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are one of a kind. Your combination of skills and experience is not replicable, it represents true freedom and the ultimate power we humans can possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success in any field is first developing skills in various areas, which you can later combine in unique and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to embrace negative experiences, limitations, and even pain as the perfect means of building up your skills levels and sharpening your sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real purpose comes from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrate on maintaining a high sense of purpose, and the success will flow to you naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a much greater chance of attracting attention by developing a high sense of purpose and creating work that will naturally draw people to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more awe-inspiring than the human brain itself - its complexity, its untapped potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resist the Downward Pull of the Group - The Law of Conformity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people operate in groups, they do not engage in nuanced thinking and deep analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their primary desire is to fit in to the group spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would have to admit that the moment we enter our work space or any group, we undergo a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the social force, a type of invisible force field that affects and binds a group of people through shared sensations and creates an intense feeling of connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;only the eyes of other people can reassure us that we are real and whole and that we belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group intelligence a thorough understanding of the effect that groups have on our thinking and emotions; with such awareness, we can resist the downward pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and primary effect on you in any group is the desire to fit in and cement your sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the group setting, we are always performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third effect of the group on us - the contagiousness of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fourth effect on us is to make us feel more certain about what we and our colleagues are doing, which makes us all the more prone to taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never relinquish your ability to doubt, reflect, and consider other options - your rationality as an individual is your only protection against the madness that can overcome a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no matter the type of culture, or how disruptive it might have been in its origins, the longer a group exists and the larger it grows, the more conservative it will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any group will reflexively focus on some hated enemy, real or imagined, to help bring the tribe together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a group, we get a narcissistic boost from being around those who share our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must become a consummate observer of yourself as you interact with groups of any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel strong and confident about what makes you unique - your taste, your values, your own experience - you can more easily resist the group effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by relying upon your work and accomplishments to anchor your self-opinion, you won&apos;t be so tied to constantly seeking approval and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reality group consists of members who feel free to contribute their diverse opinions, whose minds are open, and whose focus is on getting work done and cooperating on a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must come to the conclusion that the primary group we belong to is that of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the dysfunctional dynamic of the group, which tends to produce incompetent lieutenants and grandiose leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What creates a functional, healthy dynamic is the ability of the group to maintain a tight relationship to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instill a collective sense of purpose - you group has a definite purpose, a positive mission that unites its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemble the right team of lieutenants, people who have skills that you lack that are diverse in temperament, background, and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from mistakes will make the team that much more confident moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by participating in a high-functioning reality group, we can make ourselves healthy and whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make Them Want to Follow You - Law of Fickleness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people are always ambivalent about those in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are no longer powerful kings and queens in our midst, more of us than ever operate as if we consider ourselves royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everything we get from others, and most definitely their respect, must be earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to show that our primary consideration is not ourselves and our sensitive egos but the welfare of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect the members of the group to follow our lead and prove themselves in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love certain people and hate others; we respect and admire this individual and have nothing but disdain for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t feel comfortable with the inferiority and dependence that comes with serving under a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to our primary task - that of providing a vision for the group and leading it toward the appropriate goals - we must be stern and immovable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must make yourself a consummate observer of the phenomenon of authority, using as a measuring device the degree of influence people wield without the use of force or motivational speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we must recognize the myriad dangers of our prejudice against authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must embrace the risks and dangers that comes with leadership and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that the essence of authority is that people willingly follow your lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority you establish must emerge naturally from your character; from the particular strengths you possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans are self-absorbed by nature and spend most of our time focusing inwardly on our emotions, on our wounds, on our fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hone your listening skills, absorbing yourself in the words and nonverbal cues of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you dedicate yourself to earning people&apos;s respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you consider being a leader a tremendous responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you absorb yourself in the work, not your ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who maintain their presence of mind and elevate their perspective above the moment tap into the visionary power of the human mind and cultivate that third eye for unseen forces and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the leader, you must be seen working as hard as or even harder than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop the highest possible standards for your own work and by training yourself to be constantly aware of how your manner and tone affect people in the subtlest of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the leader, you want to be more mysterious, to establish a presence that fascinates people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must learn to balance presence and absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence is a form of absence and withdrawal that draws attention; it spells self-control and power; when you do talk, it has a greater effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are living off the fruits of millions of people in the past who have made your life incomparably easier through their struggles and inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are here not merely to gratify your impulses and consume what others have made but to make and contribute as well, to serve a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge things and people for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace what makes you different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;See the Hostility Behind the Friendly Facade - the Law of Aggression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they get to where they&apos;re going primarily through their aggressive energy, not through their particular talents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they value amassing power more than the quality of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not like to share power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dealing with this type, you will tend to become angry or fearful, enlarging their presence and playing into their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand their primary motivation - to gain control over the environment and the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us understand that human have been capable of much violence and aggression in the past and in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling of love often turn to hostility and aggression in people, because it is in love that we feel most dependent, vulnerable, and helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are willful creatures who craves power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for power is not evil or antisocial; it is a natural response to the awareness of our essential weakness and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;human aggression stems from an underlying insecurity, as opposed to simply an impulse to hurt or take from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is truly strong from within can endure criticism and open discussion without feeling personally threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also be aware that aggressors see the people around them as object to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you must stop denying the reality of your own aggressive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make yourself a master observer of aggression in the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if people know what it is you want and how to get it for you, they have some power over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;almost nothing in the world can resist persistent human energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will either find a way, or make a way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seize the Historical Moment - The Law of Generational Myopia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always discontent below the surface, and hunger for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing in human culture stands still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what drives these changes is the continual succession of new generations of young people, who are trying to create something more relevant to their experience of the world, something that reflects more their values and spirit and that goes in a different direction from that of the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generational awareness. To attain it, first we must understand the actual profound effect that our generation has on how we view the world, and second we must understand the larger generational patterns that shape history and recognize where our time period fits into the overall scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our generation has inherited from our parents and the past certain key values and ways of looking at the world that remained unquestioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you alter your attitude toward your own generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to understand as deeply as possible how profoundly the spirit of your generation, and the times that you live in, have influenced how you perceive the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are a product of the times as much as anyone; the generation you were born into has shaped your thoughts and values, whether you are aware of this or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may feel a deep need to create something new and more relevant to your generation, but the past will almost always exercise a strong pull on you, in the form of the values of your parents that you internalized at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is human nature for people to crave more social interaction with whom they feel an affinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meditations]]></title><description><![CDATA[You have power over your mind - not outside events.

&lt;p&gt;You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people&apos;s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my character required improvement and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refrain from fault-finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should find fault without reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to do good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to cherish good hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man&apos;s acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for cleaning away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seem to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the offences which are committed through desire are more blamable than those which are committed through anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;regulate every act and thought accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WE OUGHT to consider that our life is daily wasting away and a smaller part of it is left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make for thyself a definition or description of the things which is presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirely, and tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let not act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from thee are all things, in thee are all thing, to thee all things return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thy life is short. Thou must turn to profit and the present by the aid of reason and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he is a stranger to the universe who does not know what is in it, no less is he a stranger who does not know what is going on in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine men&apos;s ruling principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all thing which exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have what the universal nature will me to have; and I do what my nature now wills me to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;other things trouble me not; for they are either things without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled and know not the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all working together to one end, some with knowledge and design, and others without knowing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and as much as it is possible, be in the speaker&apos;s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the wrong which is done by a man stay there where the wrong was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that no men can escape his destiny, the next inquiry being how he may best live the time that he has to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread of thy destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thou must blame nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nothing should be done without a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything exists for some end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do it with reference to the good of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember that neither the future nor the past pains thee, but only the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who does not know what world is, does not know where he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss is nothing else than change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and how him his error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the properties of the rational soul; it sees itself, analyses itself, and makes itself such as it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for every man is allowed to seek his own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No man can rob us of our free will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often wondered how it is that every man love himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much more respect have we to what our neighbors shall think of us than to what we shall think of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter, form, and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every man lives the present time only, and loses only this.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Genghis Khan And The Making Of The Modern World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fate did not hand Genghis Khan his destiny; he made it for himself. a tortured manipulation of public fear and hope.

&lt;p&gt;a tortured manipulation of public fear and hope. The objective of such tactics was simple and always the same; to frighten the enemy into surrendering before an actual battle began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genghis Khan recognized that warfare was not a sporting contest or a mere match rivals; it was a total commitment of one people against another. Victory did not come to the one who played by the rules; it came to the one who made the rules and imposed them on his enemy. Triumph could not be partial. It was complete, total, and undeniable - or it was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance would be met with death, loyalty with security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person&apos;s breath and unique body aroma is thought to constitute a part of that person&apos;s soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name imparted to the child its character, fate, and destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he would judge others primarily by their actions toward him and not according to their kinship bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had to choose his own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find success sand to triumph over others, one must first be granted supernatural power from the spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s allies could be tomorrow&apos;s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the appointment of loyal allies as opposed to family members to key positions in his entourage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he accepted the conquered people into his tribe with the possibility that they would share fairly in the future conquests and prosperity of his army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kill the leaders and absorb the survivors and all their goods and animals into his tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using gossip as a way to build confidence in their own men and to weaken the enemy&apos;s resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terror was the best spread not by the acts of warriors, but the pens of scribes and scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you insult the mother who gave you your life from her heart, if you cause her love for you to freeze up, even if you apologize to her later, the damage is done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;key to leadership was self-control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you can&apos;t swallow your pride, you can&apos;t lead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only say what needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader should demonstrate his thoughts and opinions through his actions, not through his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without the vision of a goal, a man cannot manage his own life, much less the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will be easy to forget your vision and purpose once you have fine clothes, fast horses, and beautiful women.&quot; In that case, &quot;you will be no better than a slave, and you will surely lose everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may conquer an army with superior tactics and men, but you can conquer a nation only by conquering the hearts of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We always agree in our principles and we are always united in mutual affection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tools Of Titans]]></title><description><![CDATA[Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man health, wealthy, and wise.

&lt;p&gt;When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call &apos;life&apos; was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you&apos;ll never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you&apos;re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That&apos;s the moment you may be starting to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of your life is the quality of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you&apos;re suffering is you&apos;re focused on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake you can make is to accept the norms of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be the silence that listens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t force it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to stop doing things you love in order to nurture the one thing that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, young creative minds don&apos;t need more ideas, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they&apos;ve already got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline equals freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you seek is seeking you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency driven by a deep love of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a continual process of arrival into who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write to please just one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be prepared to fail. That&apos;s how you&apos;re going to expand yourself and grow. As you work through that process of failure and learning, you will really deepen into the human being you&apos;re capable of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one&apos;s courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair because, first of all, we don&apos;t understand ourselves, and even if we do understand ourselves, we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people. Therefore, to be furious and enraged and bitter that people don&apos;t get all of who we are is a really cruel piece of immaturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best art divides the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynicism is a disease that robs people of the gift of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be yourself. Everyone else is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It&apos;s just like building muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule of handling conflict is don&apos;t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any situation in life, you only have three options. You always have three options. You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no adults. Everyone&apos;s making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be willing to fail or succeed on who you really are. Don&apos;t ever try to be anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs. It&apos;s the same thing - fear = but it&apos;s what you do with it that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had the opportunity, did I choose courage over comfort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame is &apos;I am a bad person.&apos; Guilt is &apos;I did something bad.&apos; Shame is a focus on self. Guilt is a focus on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t go for funny. Go for the truth, and you&apos;ll hit funny along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always tell the truth. It&apos;s the easiest thing to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must want to be a butterfly so badly; you are willing to give up being a caterpillar.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making Music 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The drums often provide the essential timekeeping elements, while the bass often provides the notes that define and anchor the chord…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/making-music/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/making-music/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The drums often provide the essential timekeeping elements, while the bass often provides the notes that define and anchor the chord progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the attributes of &lt;strong&gt;sound&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;harmony&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;melody&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;mise en place&lt;/strong&gt; comes from the culinary world and refers to the careful preparation that goes into setting the physical and mental space prior to the actual work of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply arbitrary constraints before starting to work, this helps to limit your field of options and allows you to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation Phase&lt;/strong&gt;: your goal should be to capture as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing Phase&lt;/strong&gt;: your goal is to carefully refine the material that you generated during the creation phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tempo&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the defining characteristics of genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to build your own default or template project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeboxing&lt;/strong&gt; simply means setting a fixed amount of time for a particular task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your creative time is essential; you should treat it with care and recognize when you&apos;re subconsciously trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of creating art is, fundamentally, a process of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important sounds are typically mixed louder than less important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds can be made to seem closer to the listener by making them louder, &quot;brighter&quot; an increase in high frequency content in comparison to other sounds, and/or &quot;dryer an increase in the amount of original, unprocessed signal in comparison to the amount of reverb applied to that signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of our musical elements themselves as being divided into &lt;strong&gt;foreground&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;middle ground&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;background&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to hear things as being in the foreground if they&apos;re high, loud, fast, or subject to a rapid rate of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipation&lt;/strong&gt; - Drums fills are a common technique used to create a sense of transition from one section to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hesitation&lt;/strong&gt; - Drum fill that lasts longer than expected, extending over the formal boundary between the sections and ending after the rest of the musical material has already changed to the new section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transposition&lt;/strong&gt; means shifting an entire pattern of notes up or down by a specific number of semitones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inversion&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of flipping a collection of notes &quot;upside-down&quot; so that the lowest note becomes the first note and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrograde/Reverse&lt;/strong&gt; means flipping a collection of notes backwards, so that the last note becomes the first note and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Shifting&lt;/strong&gt; - A looped passage of material can be started at an arbitrary position within the passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitch Rotation&lt;/strong&gt; is a process where the rhythm of a passage of notes is retained but the pitches from the passage are shifted to the right or left in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantization&lt;/strong&gt; is typically used to correct timing errors in manually played MIDI materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slicing&lt;/strong&gt; is typically to separate rhythmic events such as drum hits from audio material such as drum beats or bass lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tresillo&lt;/strong&gt;, or 3+3+2 pattern, is a widely used rhythmic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-hats&lt;/strong&gt; keep time, kick drums emphasize the beats, snares/claps are placed on or around the backbeats beats 2 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyphony&lt;/strong&gt; - multiple instruments can play at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monophonic&lt;/strong&gt; - no two instruments can play at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost notes&lt;/strong&gt; are extremely quiet notes, normally played on the snare drum, that help to fill in the space between the prominent notes in the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;EQ&lt;/strong&gt; to create space for the bass in the kick drum&apos;s track, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;EQ&lt;/strong&gt; on every other track to remove low end, which makes room for both kick and bass while reducing overall signal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;sidechain compression&lt;/strong&gt; to automatically reduce the gain of the bass when the kick is sounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the spectrum analyzer to find the frequencies that are louder than the average noise level, and then use &lt;strong&gt;EQ&lt;/strong&gt; to either emphasize those frequency if they happen to be in tune) or attenuate them if they&apos;re out of tune with respect to the harmonic and melodic part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-stretching&lt;/strong&gt;: adjusting the pitch of a sample independently of its tempo vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;contour&lt;/strong&gt; is used to refer to the shape of a melody over time - whether the note rise to higher pitches, fall to lower ones, remain at the same pitch, or some combination of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;strong&gt;contour&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss whether a melody moves by adjacent notes known as &lt;strong&gt;conjunct motion&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;motion by step&lt;/strong&gt; or by larger intervals known as &lt;strong&gt;disjunct motion&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;motion by leap&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good melodies have a strong sense of balance between both aspects of contour: rise vs. fall and conjunct motions vs disjunct motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a melody has moved by step for a while, a good choice might be to then proceed by leap in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good melodies often have a single peak note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a 4/4 meter, the first and third beat are considered &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;on&quot; beats while the second and fourth are considered &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;off&quot; beats. The odd-numbered subdivisions are perceived as stronger than the even-numbered ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smallest recognizable fragment of a melody is called a motive, and melodies are often constructed from just one or two motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of two or more intricate, independent, simultaneous melodies in a composition is called &lt;strong&gt;counterpoint&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrary motion&lt;/strong&gt;, as a general guideline, counterpoint works best when the voices mostly move in opposite directions; one voice moves up while the other moves down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hocket&lt;/strong&gt; is a compositional technique in which the notes of a melodic line quickly alternate between two or more different instrument, such that not two instruments are playing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;sound-color melody&quot; refers to the distribution of a melody or even a single pitch between multiple instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scansion&lt;/strong&gt; is the study of a text&apos;s inherent rhythm and the marking of each syllable in the text as being either strongly or weakly stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most music is considered to be in a particular key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the separate voices when moving between chords is known as voice leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of house music chord progressions are a technique called &lt;strong&gt;parallel harmony&lt;/strong&gt;, which refers to a method of moving from one chord to another in which each note move by the same number of semitones and in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate at which the chords change in a piece of music is called the &lt;strong&gt;hormonic rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface rhythm is the rhythm of individual notes and other events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general but by no means universal rule, music with a faster surface rhythm tends to have a slower harmonic rhythm, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps most commonly used to precisely sculpt a mix to ensure that levels will be perfectly balanced at all points of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;arrangement&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the layout of the parts of your song along a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating successful arrangements requires having a great internal sense of proportion, an understanding of how long each song section needs to be in relation to the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verse&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&quot;A&quot; Section&lt;/strong&gt;: A song&apos;s verse is generally a recurring section - usually 16 or 32 bars in length - that serves as the main body of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chorus&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&quot;B&quot; Section&lt;/strong&gt;: It acts as a contrast to the material of the verse and usually contains the &quot;hook&quot; of the song - a melodic idea that is intended to stick in the listener&apos;s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In music with lyrics, the chorus often contains the title of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general rule, the first chorus in a song occurs after a verse although there are some songs that begin with a chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge serves as a contrast to both the verse and chorus and typically occurs only once in a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layering&lt;/strong&gt;: the careful addition and subtraction of parts in order to change the density of the underlying texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buildup&lt;/strong&gt;: usually 16 or 32 bars in length, or some multiple of those - in which layers are added, increasing the music&apos;s textural density and perceived sense of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;breakdown&lt;/strong&gt; is a section of lower energy, designed as a contrast to the buildup, and involves either a gradual or sudden reduction in density. Some common breakdown techniques include removing all of the drum elements or, conversely, removing everything except drums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop&lt;/strong&gt;: The drop is the climax and is generally the most texturally dense passage of music in the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique events&lt;/strong&gt; - sounds, gestures, or variation that occur only once and are never repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single events&lt;/strong&gt; are short samples or sounds that can be strategically placed throughout your arrangement to add a layer of unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single musical gesture&lt;/strong&gt; are short phrases or one-time alterations to otherwise consistently repeating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single processing gesture&lt;/strong&gt;, one-time changes to the effects processing on one more track.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Art of Seduction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Seducers are people who master the art of making people fall in love.

&lt;p&gt;It is much more effective to create love than lust, because a person in love is emotional, pliable, and easily misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person in love will surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seducers are never self-absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seducers see themselves as providers of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seducer sees all of life as theater, everyone an actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Every seduction has two elements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yourself and what is seductive about you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your target and the actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction begin with your character, your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people and stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nine Seducer Types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sirens&lt;/strong&gt; have an abundance of sexual energy and know how to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rakes&lt;/strong&gt; insatiably adore the opposite sex, and their desire is infectious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Lovers&lt;/strong&gt; have an aesthetic sensibility that they apply to romance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dandies&lt;/strong&gt; like to play with their image, creating a striking and androgynous allure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturals&lt;/strong&gt; are spontaneous and open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coquettes&lt;/strong&gt; are self-sufficient, with a fascinating cool at their core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt; want and know how to please they are social creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charismatics&lt;/strong&gt; have an unusual confidence in themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stars&lt;/strong&gt; are ethereal and envelop themselves in mystery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Seductive Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Choose the Right Victim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction is a process that occurs over time - the longer you take and the slower you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People&apos;s thoughts tend to revolve around their daily concerns and insecurities, you cannot proceed with a seduction until you slowly put their anxieties to sleep and fill their distracted minds with thoughts of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything depends on the target of your seduction; the perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay greater attention to those responses outside conscious control - a blush, an involuntary mirroring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of anger or resentment. All of these show that you are having an effect on a person who is open to your influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect victim is the person who stirs you in a way that cannot be explained in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Create a False Sense of Security - Approach Indirectly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have chosen the right person, you must make the target come to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more effective in seduction than making the seduced think that they are the one doing the seducing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Send Mixed Signal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attractiveness will pass unless you spark the more enduring kind of spell that makes people think of you in your absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture and hold attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Appear to be an Object of Desire - Create Triangles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make people compete for your attention, make them see you as sought after by everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let your targets see you so often, keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach. An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Create a Need - Stir Anxiety and Discontent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness is the weakness on which all seducers prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your task as a seducer is to create a wound in your victim, aiming at their soft spot, the chink in their self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups or nations as well as individuals: they cannot be seduced without being made to feel some lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Master the Art of Insinuation.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sow a seductive idea, you will need to engage people&apos;s imaginations, their fantasies, their deepest yearning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seduction it is better not to talk about your love for a person. Let your target read it in your manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hints, suggestions, and insinuations create a seductive atmosphere, signaling that their victim is no longer involved in the routines of daily life but has entered another realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Enter Their Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to lure people out of their natural intractability and self-obsession is to enter their spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to entice people out of this shell is to become more like them, in fact kind of mirror image of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Create Temptation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a seducer, you can never mistake people&apos;s appearance for reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most potent temptations often involve psychological taboos and forbidden fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9. Keep Them in Suspense - What Comes Next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of an elemental human pleasure: being led by a person who knows where they are going, and who takes us on a journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling in love involves anticipation; we are about to head off in a new direction, enter a new life, where everything will be strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that happens suddenly seems natural, and anything that seems natural has a seductive charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;10. Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot seduce without an ability to get outside your own skin and inside another person&apos;s, piercing their psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to see words as a tool not for communicating true thoughts and feelings but for confusing, delighting, and intoxicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must say things that please - things that relate to people&apos;s lives, that touch their vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay vague and ambiguous, allowing the reader the space to imagine and fantasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;11. Pay Attention to Detail&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seduction, you are always trying to bring the target back to the golden moments of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gift has immense seductive power, but the object itself is less important than the gesture, and the subtle thought or emotion that it communicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;12. Poeticize Your Presence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often likely to fall for someone who resembles us in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are dying to be given the chance to fantasize about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: if you are easily had, you cannot be worth that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;13. Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is natural to your character is inherently seductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What works best is to allow people an occasional glimpse into the soft, frail side of your character, and usually only after they have known you for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display of a single weakness will hide a multitude of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;14. Confuse Desire and Reality - The Perfect Illusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you aim for is &quot;uncanny&quot;, something strange and familiar at the same time, like a deja vu, or a childhood memory - anything slightly irrational and dreamlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you set things up like a play or a piece of fiction, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;15. Isolate the Victim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seduction, as in warfare, the isolated target is weak and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To seduce your targets, you need to lure them away, gently, slowly, from the affairs that fill their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;16. Prove Yourself&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, a seduction fails because the seducer does not correctly read the resistance of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand a primary law of seduction: resistance is a sign that the other person&apos;s emotions are engaged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat of seduction is raised by such challenges - show me that you really love me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;17. Effect a Regression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give people a sensation similar to that protected, dependent feeling of childhood and they will project all kinds of fantasies onto you, including feelings of love or sexual attraction that they will attribute to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;18. Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a person the sense that with you they will have a chance to explore the outer reaches of acceptable, polite behavior, that with you they can vent some of their closeted personality, and you create the ingredients for a deep and powerful seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every deeply held value there is a shadow side, a doubt, a desire to explore what those values forbid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;19. Use Spiritual Lures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that seduction is a mental process, and nothing more mentally intoxicating than religion, spirituality, and the occult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where too much is controlled and manufactured, the sense that fate, necessity, or some higher power is guiding your relationship is doubly seductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;20. Mix Pleasure with Pain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have more to fear by boring your targets than by shaking them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wounding people binds them to you more deeply than kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling is love means literally falling - losing control, a mix of fear and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a seducer you must find a way to lower people&apos;s resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your seduction should never follow a simple course upward toward pleasure and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes us intensely appreciate something is previous suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not worry about making people angry; anger is a sure sign that you have your hooks in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;21. Give Them Space to Fall - The Pursuer is Pursued&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t want a passive little victim to toy with; you want the seduced to engage their will in all its force, to become active participants in the seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&apos;s willpower is directly linked to their libido, their erotic desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn to love only through rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By experiencing a rejection or a coldness, we learn to court and pursue, to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to win you back, to have you for sure, will be to reverse the pattern, to imitate you, to be the affectionate, giving one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;22. Use Physical Lures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to relax a distracted mind is to make it focus on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a seducer, you are a hypnotist, and what you are making the target focus on is you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seducer leads the victim to a point where he or she reveals involuntary signs of physical excitation that can be read in various symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction, like warfare, is often a game of distance and closeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;23. Master the Art of the Bold Move&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, timid people are often self-absorbed, obsessed with the way people see them, and not at all saintly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasure of the one who surrenders is often greater than that of the aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are creating a moment that must stand out from the sameness of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;24. Beware the Aftereffects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction is a kind of spell, an enchantment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity is the death of seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is not seductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have seduced a person there is almost always a lull, a slight letdown, which sometimes leads to a separation; it is surprisingly easy, though to re-seduce the same target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revive the old images, the symbols, the expressions that will stir memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never see a separation or sacrifice as final. With a little drama and planning, a victim can be retaken in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Playbook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attraction comes before seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attraction is not a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leader of men. When you lead the men, the woman will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convey lack of interest. As you demonstrate value and an utter lack of neediness, she will start to open up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She must become invested in this interaction, and then rapport must be established. Attraction is useful to bait her into investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she demonstrates value in an attempt to win you over, reward her with indicator of interest, then bait her again as the process repeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want a man who can keep it real. A girl needs to feel that she is getting to know the real you and that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security she feels from being with a strong man is a primary factor in her unconscious sexual selection strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman will almost always choose the man with higher value and a stronger frame. The only factor that counteracts this phenomenon is her level of investment in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the prize, you are the one being chased, and you decide whether this will go to the next level and the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to get her hoping that she&apos;s good enough to quality for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be natural and confident when touching, touching is one way that alpha males like you demonstrate their dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort is not only trust and time; it is also compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compliance threshold is the point of the interaction where she realizes that she has more fun if she complies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is played in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 48 Laws Of Power]]></title><description><![CDATA[LAW 1: NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-48-laws-of-power/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-48-laws-of-power/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h5&gt;LAW 1: NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite - inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 2: NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be wary of friends - they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 3: CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 4: ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 5: SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION - GUARD IT WITH YOU LIFE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 6: COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 7: GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 8: MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU - USE BAIT IF NECESSARY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains - then attack. You hold the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 9: WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory. The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 10: INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can die from someone else&apos;s misery - emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 11: LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain your independence, you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 12: USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift - a Trojan horse - will serve the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 13: WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE&apos;S SELF-INTEREST, NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 14: POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 15: CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. Sometimes they have learned this the hard way. If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 16: USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 17: KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people&apos;s actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 18: DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF - ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere - everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from - it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 19: KNOW WHO YOU&apos;RE DEALING WITH - DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs&apos; clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then - never offend or deceive the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 20: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others - playing people against one another, making them pursue you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 21: PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER - SEEM DUMBER THAN YOUR MARK&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smart - and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 22: USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are weaker, never fight for honor&apos;s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you - surrender first. By turning the other cheek, you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 23: CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another - intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 24: PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 25: RE-CREATE YOURSELF&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions - your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 26: KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat&apos;s paws to disguise your involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 27: PLAY ON PEOPLE&apos;S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULTLIKE FOLLOWING&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 28: ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 29: PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end, you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 30: MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work - it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 31: CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best deception are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 32: PLAY TO PEOPLE&apos;S FANTASIES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and stressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 33: DISCOVER EACH MAN&apos;S THUMBSCREW&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 34: BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 35: MASTER THE ART OF TIMING&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never seem to be in a hurry - hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 36: DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging a petty problem, you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 37: CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power - everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 38: THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 39: STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 40: DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is offered for free is dangerous - it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price - there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 41: AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN&apos;S SHOES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 42: STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual - the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them - they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 43: WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others it to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 44: DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them over-react. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 45: PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO MUCH AT ONCE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 46: NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 47: DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN VICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LAW 48: ASSUME FORMLESSNESS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the functional programming paradigm, funcitons are the basic building blocks, all values are immutable, and the code is declarative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closure has access to variable values both inside and outside of the code block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lexical scope is related to the visibility of the variables in the code where they were defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function arity is the number of arguments a function receivies, commonly expressed as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;name_of_the_function/arity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#x26; operator to capture a reference to the function, it&apos;s a short way of binding named functions to variables or functions&apos; arguments. We can also use the &amp;#x26; operator to create anonymous functions with arity greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elixir pattern matching is useful for assigning variables, unpacking values, and making decisions such as which function to invoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can bind new values for existing variables, this is called rebinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can avoid the rebinding by using the pin operator: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern matching is also useful for extracting parts of values to variables in a process called destructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A keyword list is a list of two-element tuples: it allows duplicated keys but they must be atoms, are useful for function options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigils are shortcuts to create values with a simplified text representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Elixir we call these multiple function definitions function clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can apply a default value to named function arguments using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard clauses permit us to add Boolean expresssions in our functions, adding more power to our function clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create macro functions to be used in guard clauses with the defgaurd directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case is useful when we want to check an expression with multiple pattern-matching clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cond control flow is useful when you want to check different variables and values in logical expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bounded recursion is a type of recursive function in which the successive calls to itself have an end. The boundary clause is very important; it should always be defined before the clauses that can be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decrease and conquer is a technique for reducing a problem to its simplest form and starting to solve it incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divide-and-conquer technique is about separating the problem into two or more parts that can be processed independently and can be combined in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tail-call optimization is when the compiler reduces functions in memory without allocating more memory. To use it, we need to ensure that the last expression of our function is a function call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbounded recurrsion is when we can&apos;t predict the number of repetition for a recursive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-order functions are those that have functions in their arguments and/or can return functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipe operator is useful for combining functions to achieve a greater goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A behavior is a contract between a module and the client code that&apos;s using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need both pure and impure functions to write useful software. In order to build maintainable software, you should produce more pure functions while isolating the impure parts with proper handling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Alchemist]]></title><description><![CDATA["To realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation." It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-alchemist/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-alchemist/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;To realize one&apos;s destiny is a person&apos;s only obligation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&apos;s greatest lie: that at a certain point in our lives, we lost control of what&apos;s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something it&apos;s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in life has its price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m like everyone else - I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You must always know what it is that you want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it&apos;s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the story of the world were written by the same hand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things are the manifestation of one thing only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve the Master Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everyone has his or her own way of learning things but, we&apos;re both in search of our Personal Legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is the moment we&apos;re living right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that whatever you hear is, there you will find your treasure. You&apos;ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that because it wasn&apos;t true love... the love that speaks the Language of the World.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to learn and it&apos;s through action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;God created the world so that through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don&apos;t deserve them, or that they&apos;ll be unable to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second&apos;s encounter with God and with eternity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don&apos;t want people to suffer because they don&apos;t follow their hearts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we&apos;ve learned as we&apos;ve moved toward that dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your eyes show the strength of your soul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Programming Pearls Second Edition]]></title><description><![CDATA[Careful analysis of a small problem can sometimes yield tremendous practical benefits. The Bitmap Data Structure: This data structure…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/programming-pearls/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/programming-pearls/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Careful analysis of a small problem can sometimes yield tremendous practical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitmap Data Structure: This data structure represents a dense set over a finite domain when each element occurs at most once and no other data is associated with the element. Even if these conditions aren&apos;t satisfied when there are multiple elements or extra data, for instance, a key from a finite domain can be used as an index into a table with more complicated entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple-Pass Algorithms: algorithms make several passes over their input data, accomplishing a little more each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less data to process means less time to process it, that reducing a program&apos;s space requirements also reduces its run time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signature: When an equivalence relation defines classes, it is helpful to define a signature and no other item does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper view of data does indeed structure programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t write a big program when a little one will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data structure can reduce big programs to small programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing correct programs involves: problem definition, algorithm design, and data structure selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop invariant: This assertion about the program state an invariant because it is true at the beginning and end of each iteration of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program verification: Programmers have a deeper understanding of programs, if they execute the program by hand on one input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise programmers instead build scaffolding to give them easy access to the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divide-and-conquer: To solve a problem of size n, recursively solve two subproblems of size approximately n/2, and combine their solutions to yield a solution to the complete problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing space often has desirable side-effects on run time: smaller programs are faster to load and fit more easily into a cache, and less data to manipulate usually means less time to manipulate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplicity can yield functionality, robustness, speed, and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Code tuning&quot; locates the expensive parts of an existing program and then makes little changes to improve its speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premature optimization is the root of much programming evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;RULES FOR CODE TUNING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Space-For-Time Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Structure Augmentation&lt;/strong&gt;. The time required for common operation on data can often be reduced by augmenting the structure with extra information or by changing the information within the structure so that it can be accessed more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store Precomputed Results&lt;/strong&gt;. The cost of recomputing an expensive function can be reduced by computing the function only once and storing the results. Subsequent requests for the function are then handled by table lookup rather than by computing the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caching&lt;/strong&gt;. Data that is accessed most often should be the cheapest to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;. The strategy of never evaluating an item until it is needed avoids evaluations of unnecessary items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Time-For-Space Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packing&lt;/strong&gt;. Dense storage representations can decrease storage costs by increasing the time required to store and retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreters&lt;/strong&gt;. The space required to represent a program can often be decreased by the use of interpreters in which common sequences of operations are represented compactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Loop Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Motion Out of Loops&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of performing a certain computation in each iteration of a loop, it is better to perform it only once, outside the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining Tests&lt;/strong&gt;. An efficient inner loop should contain as few tests as possible, and preferably only one. The programmer should therefore try to simulate some of the exit conditions of the loop by other exit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loop Unrolling&lt;/strong&gt;. Unrolling a loop can remove the cost of modifying loop indices, and also help to avoid pipeline stalls, to reduce branches, and to increase instruction-level parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer-Driven Loop Unrolling&lt;/strong&gt;. If a large cost of an inner loop is devoted to trivial assignments, then those assignments can often be removed by repeating the code and changing the use of variables. Specifically, to remove the assignment i = j, the subsequent code must treat j as though it were i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconditional Branch Removal&lt;/strong&gt;. A fast loop should contain no unconditional branches. An unconditional branch at the end of a loop can be removed by &quot;rotating&quot; the loop to have a conditional branch at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loop Fusion&lt;/strong&gt;. If two nearby loops operate on the same set of elements, then combine their operational parts and use only one set of loop control operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Logic Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Algebraic Identities&lt;/strong&gt;. If the evaluation of a logical expression is costly, replace it by an algebraically equivalent expression that is cheaper to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Circuiting Monotone Functions&lt;/strong&gt;. If we wish to test whether some monotone nondecreasing function of several variables is over a certain threshold, then we need not evaluate any of the variables once the threshold has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reordering Tests&lt;/strong&gt;. Logical tests should be arranged such that inexpensive and often successful tests precede expensive and rarely successful tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precompute Logical Functions&lt;/strong&gt;. A logical function over a small finite domain can be replaced by a lookup in a table that represents the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boolean Variable Elimination&lt;/strong&gt;. We can remove Boolean variables from a program by replacing the assignment to a Boolean variable v by an if - else statement in which one branch represents the case that v is true and the other represents the case that v is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Procedure Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collapsing Function Hierarchies&lt;/strong&gt;. The run times of the elements of a set of functions that nonrecursively call themselves can often be reduced by rewriting functions in line and binding the passed variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Common Cases&lt;/strong&gt;. Functions should be organized to handle all cases correctly and common cases efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coroutines&lt;/strong&gt;. A multiple-pass algorithm can often be turned into a single-pass algorithm by use of coroutines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformations on Recursive Functions&lt;/strong&gt;. The run time of recursive functions can often be reduced by rewriting recursion to iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallelism&lt;/strong&gt;. A program should be structured to exploit as much of the parallelism as possible in the underlying hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Expression Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compile-Time Initialization&lt;/strong&gt;. As many variables as possible should be initialized before program execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Algebraic Identities&lt;/strong&gt;. If the evaluation of an expression is costly, replace it by an algebraically equivalent expression that is cheaper to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Subexpression Elimination&lt;/strong&gt;. If the same expression is evaluated twice with none of its variables altered between evaluations, then the second evaluation can be avoided by storing the result of the first and using that in place of the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pairing Computation&lt;/strong&gt;. If two similar expressions are frequently evaluated together, then we should make a new procedure that evaluates them as a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Word Parallelism&lt;/strong&gt;. Use the full data-path width of the underlying computer architecture to evaluate expensive expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Functional Programming Simplified]]></title><description><![CDATA[Functional Programming FP applications consist of only immutable values and pure functions.

&lt;p&gt;Pure function means that a) a function&apos;s output depends only on its input parameters, and b) functions have no side effects, such as reading user input or writing output to a screen, disk, web service, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In FP we don&apos;t tell the computer how to do things, we just tell it what we want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;FP Rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no null values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only pure functions will be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only use immutable values for all fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you use an if, you must always also use an else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We won&apos;t create &quot;classes&quot; that encapsulate data and behaviors. Instead we&apos;ll create data structures and write pure functions that operate on those data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-Order Function HOF means that a) you can treat a function as a value and b) you can pass that value into other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Functional code is characterized by one thing: the absence of side effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern functional programming, lambda means &quot;anonymous function.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambda calculus refers to &quot;a formal way to think about functions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Things that can be mapped over shall be called Functor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combinator: &quot;a style of organizing libraries centered around the idea of combining things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mantra for writing pure functions: Output depends only on input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of impure functions. They don&apos;t have any input parameters and/or they don&apos;t return anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Memorization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Expression-Oriented Programming&quot; or EOP means every line of code returns a result evaluates to a result, and therefore an expression rather than a statement. Statements do not return results and are executes solely for their side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits of Pure Functions:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&apos;re easier to reason about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&apos;re easier to combine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&apos;re easier to test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&apos;re easier to debug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&apos;re easier to parallelize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are idempotent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They offer referential transparency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are memoizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be lazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that the theory of currying means is that a function that takes multiple arguments can be translated into a series of function calls that each take a single argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partially-applied function PAF is a function that takes a function with multiple parameters and return a function with fewer parameters. The general benefit it&apos;s a way to create specialized methods from more general methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recursive function is a function that calls itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The general recursive thought process:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the function signature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the end condition for this algorithm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the actual algorithm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tail-recursive function is a function whose very last action is a call to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FP you don&apos;t modify mutate existing objects, you create new objects with updated fields based on existing objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List comprehensions are a way to filter, transform, and combine lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure function never throws exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Composition is a fancy term which means &apos;combining&apos;... Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Composing functions together is like snapping together a series of pipes for our data to flow through.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A domain is &quot;a sphere of activity or knowledge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A domain model refers to the way we model the objects in a given domain as software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Willpower Doesn't Work - Discover The Hidden Keys To Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[There's a technological shift in our environment to produce various addictions primary to technology, but also to stimulants such as…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/willpower-doesnt-work/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/willpower-doesnt-work/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a technological shift in our environment to produce various addictions primary to technology, but also to stimulants such as caffeine, fast-absorbing foods containing high amounts of carbohydrates and sugar, and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to control your life, willpower should not be your strategy of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re required to exert willpower to do something, there is an obvious internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&apos;t know what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your desire your why for your goals isn&apos;t strong enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&apos;t invested in yourself and your dreams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your environment opposes your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conscious personal evolution involves purposefully controlling and creating environment that shape us into the person we want to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your worldview, belief, and values didn&apos;t come from within you, but from outside of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hero is a product of a situation rather than the result being a product of the hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your potential is shaped by what surrounds you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are never independent of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing and shaping your environment is at the center of what &quot;free will&quot; really means because your choice of environment and external influences will directly reflect in the person you become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who you are and what you can do in one environment is very different from who you are and what you can do in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are acting a particular way based on the rules of the situation you are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change your life, you simply change your environment and roles you are playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two key types of &quot;enriched&quot; environment are highly stressful and rest/rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must first be a certain way, then act from that place, in order to have what you want. Be -&gt; Do -&gt; Have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are where you are because of who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organization is about putting limits on things, in order to properly organize your life, you need to establish upper and lower limits on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fewer choices you have to make, the more powerful your choices will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surround yourself with people who remind you more of your future than your past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&apos;T BE A SLAVE TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREVER YOU ARE, THAT&apos;S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACT ON INSTINCT AND INTUITION, NOT IMPULSE AND DEPENDENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU NEED DEEP HUMAN CONNECTIONS TO OVERCOME ANY ADDICTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you allow yourself to be unavailable - physically, mentally, and emotionally - you&apos;ll live a far more present life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re serious about living to the highest level, you need to plan for the worst and know exactly how you will respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing functions are self-imposed situational factors that literally force you to act and achieve what you intend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning new things requires making mistakes, looking and feeling dumb, and having to rework our worldview to see things from a higher vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good emotions lead to good outcomes and negative emotions lead to negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you constantly avoid pain and mask your emotions, you&apos;ll never grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything you want is on the other side of fear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: Your avoidance of these feeling is stopping you from a life greater than your wildest imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than &quot;competing&quot; with people at your perceived skill level, compete with those who are where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True learning involves a permanent change in how you see and act in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are kept from our goals not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life gives to the giver and takes from the takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an adaptive learner is all about never getting stuck at a certain level in your development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should work in environments that trigger you into the mental state needed to do the various types of work you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;evolved&quot; you become, it is essential that you don&apos;t let it lead to egotism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stand on the shoulders of giants. You could not be where you are without the challenges you&apos;ve faced, the mentors you&apos;ve had, and the many people who have created the world you live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don&apos;t commit the fundamental attribution error in believing that others could not do or be better than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change your environment, you will change. But it must be your choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reactive Programming With RxJS - Untangle Your Asynchronous JavaScript Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[An Observable represents a stream of data.

&lt;p&gt;The Observable &quot;pushes&quot; values to consumers as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RxJS is push-based, so the source of events the Observable will push new values to the consumer the Subscriber, without the consumer requesting the next value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribers have to implement the Observer interface. The Observer interface contains three methods: next, complete, and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RxJS, methods that transform or query sequences are called operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observables are immutable, and every operator applied to them creates a new Observable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observables are just streams of events that we transform, combine, and query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Observable pipeline is a group of operators chained together, where each one takes an Observable as input and returns an Observable as output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Subject is a type that implements both Observer and Observable types. As an Observer, it can subscribe to Observables, and as an Observable it can produce values and have Observers subscribe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AsyncSubject emits the last value of a sequence only if the sequence completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an Observer subscribes to a BehaviorSubject, it receives the last emitted value and then all the subsequent values. BehaviorSubject requires that we provide a starting value, so that all Observers will always receive a value when they subscribe to a BehaviorSubject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ReplaySubject caches its values and re-emits them to any Observer that subscribe late to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Observables emit values regardless of having any subscribers. Any Subscriber subscribed to a hot Observable will receive values emitted only from the exact moment it subscribes to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold Observable emit the entire sequence of values from the start to every subscriber. A cold Observable emits values only when Subscriber subscribe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can turn a cold Observable into a hot one using publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Scheduler is a mechanism to &quot;Schedule&quot; an action to happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clean Architecture - A Craftsman's Guide To Software Structure And Design]]></title><description><![CDATA[When software is done right, it requires a fraction of the human resources to create and maintain.

Changes are simple and rapid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making messes is always slower than staying clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders: behavior and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first value of software is its behavior. Programmers are hired to make machines behave in a way that makes or saves money for the stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second value of software is, it must be easy to change. When the stakeholders change their minds about a feature, that change should be simple and easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember: If architecture comes last, then the system will become ever more costly to develop, and eventually change will become practically impossible for part or all of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradigms are ways of programming, relatively unrelated to languages. A paradigm tells you which programming structures to use, and when to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the paradigms removes capabilities from the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use polymorphism as the mechanism to cross architectural boundaries; we use functional programming to impose discipline on the location of and access to data; and we use structured programming as the algorithmic foundation of our modules. Notice how well those three align with the three big concerns of architecture: function, separation of components, and data management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed into provable units, which in turn means that modules can be functionally decomposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured programming forces us to recursively decompose a program into a set of small provable functions. We can then use test to try to prove those small provable function incorrect. If such test fails to prove incorrectness, then we deem the functions to be correct enough for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that OO languages provide safe and convenient polymorphism means that any source code dependency, no matter where it is, can be inverted. Any source code dependencies can be turned around by inserting an interface between them. Dependency Inversion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software architects working in system written in OO languages have absolute control over the direction of all source code dependencies in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All race conditions, deadlock conditions, and concurrent condition or a concurrent update problem are due to mutable variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Single Responsibility Principle SRP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software systems are changed to satisfy a group of one or more people, we&apos;ll refer to them as an actor and are the &quot;reason to change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Open-Closed Principle OCP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If component &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; should be protected from changes in component &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, then component &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; should depend on component &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Liskov Substitution Principle LSP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for each object &lt;strong&gt;o1&lt;/strong&gt; of type &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; there is an object &lt;strong&gt;o2&lt;/strong&gt; of type &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; such that for all programs &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; defined in terms of &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;, the behavior of &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; is unchanged when &lt;strong&gt;o1&lt;/strong&gt; is substituted for &lt;strong&gt;o2&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; is a subtype of &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Interface Segregation Principle ISP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is harmful to depend on modules that contain more than you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Dependency Inversion Principle DIP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most flexible system are those in which source code dependencies refer only to abstraction, not to concretions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the volatile concrete element of our system that we want to avoid depending on, therefore interfaces are less volatile than implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components are the units of deployment, they are the smallest entities that can be deployed as part of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A directed acyclic graph DAG: Regardless of which component you begin at, it is impossible to follow the dependency relationships and wind up back at that component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stability is related to the amount of work required to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to determine the stability of a component is to count the number of dependencies that enter and leaves that component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan-in: Incoming dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan-out: Outgoing dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instability &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; = Fan-out ÷ Fan-in + Fan-out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; = 0 indicates a maximally stable component. &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; = 1 indicates a maximally unstable component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changeable component are on top and depend on the stable component at the bottom. The &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; metrics should decrease in the direction of dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable Abstraction Principle SAP: A stable component should also be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended. An unstable component should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranging our systems into a plugin architecture creates firewalls across which changes cannot propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency arrows are arranged to point from lower-level details to higher-level abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business rules are rules or procedures that make or save the business money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Entity is an object within our computer system that embodies a small set of critical business rules operating on Critical Business Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A use case is a description of the way that an automated system is used. It specifies the input to be provided by the user, the output to be returned to the user, and the processing steps involved in producing that output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good architectures are centered on use cases so that architects can safely describe the structures that support those use cases without committing to frameworks, tools, and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency Rule: Source code dependencies must point only inward, toward higher-level policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Humble Object pattern is a design pattern that was originally identified as a way to help unit testers to separate behaviors that are hard to test from behaviors that are easy to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database gateways are polymorphic interfaces that contain methods for every create, read, update, or delete operation that can be performed by the application on the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data mapper load data into data structures from relational database tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of Main as a plugin to the application - a plugin that sets up the initial conditions and configurations, gathers all the outside resources, and then hands control over to high-level policy of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test are the most isolated system component, nothing within the system depends on tests, and the tests always depend inward on the components of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First make it work, then make it right, then make it fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Node.js 8 the Right Way - Practical, Server-Side JavaScript That Scales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Node.js's philosophy is to give you low-level access to the event-loop and to system resources.

&lt;p&gt;Node.js is a single-thread environment, or in other words &quot;everything runs in parallel except your code.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event Emitter provides a channel for events to be dispatched and listeners to be notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Buffer is Nodejs&apos;s way of representing binary data. It points to a blob of memory allocated by Nodejs&apos;s native code, outside of the JavaScript engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networked services exist to do two things: connect endpoints and transmit information between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP socket connections consist of two endpoints. One endpoint binds to a numbered port while the other endpoint connects to a port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protocol is a set of rules that defines how endpoints in a system communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong convention in the Node community to put supporting code in the lib directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular dependencies are used at runtime by your code when you use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;require()&lt;/code&gt; to bring in modules. Dev dependences are programs that your project needs during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Semantic versioning convention:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your code change does not introduce or remove any functionality like a bug fix, then just increment the patch version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your code introduces functionality but doesn&apos;t remove or alter existing functionality, then increment the minor version and reset the patch version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your code in any way breaks existing functionality, then increment the major version and reset the minor version and reset the patch version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;publish/subscribe PUB/SUB EX. The server would publish information in this format, and any number of client programs could subscribe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;request/reply REQ/REP EX. a request comes in, then a reply goes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROUTER Socket are like parallel REP socket, can handle many requests simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEALER Socket are like parallel REQ, can send multiple requests in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustering is a useful technique for scaling up your Node.js application when there&apos;s unused CPU capacity available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;forking creates a worker process running the same scripts as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spawning a Child Process works great for executing non-Node.js processes from your Node.js program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PUSH and PULL Socket types are useful when you have a queue of jobs that you want to assign among a pool of available workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message traveling from a PUSH socket to a PULL socket is one-way: the puller can&apos;t send a response back through the same socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of compiling source code from one programming language into another or from one language version to another version is called transpiling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Art Of Choosing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Choice, ranging from the trivial to the life-altering, in both its presence and its absence, is an inextricable part of our life.

&lt;p&gt;We can measure our lives by the choices we make, the sum total of which has brought us to wherever and whoever we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak of choice, we must evaluate all available options and select the best one, making the mind as vital to choose as the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to choose well is arguably the most powerful tool for controlling our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the ability to create choice by altering our interpretation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish to see our lives as offering us choice and the potential for control, even in the most dismal of circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We tell ourselves stories in order to live.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice connects us and allows us to speak to one another about freedom and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want and need to be in control of our lives, but how we understand control depends on the stories we are told and the beliefs we come to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualist are primarily motivated by their own preferences, needs, rights, and the contracts they have established with others and give priority to their personal goals over the goals of others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only freedom deserving the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, long as we do not attempt to deprive others of their, or impede their efforts to obtain it... Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, then by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectivist are primary motivated by the norms of, and duties imposed by, those collectives and are willing to give priority to the goals of these collective over their own personal goals, emphasizing above all else their connectedness to members of these collectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people so choose, they can take control of their own lives and achieve anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see determines how you interpret the world, which in turn influences what you expect of the world and how you expect the story of your life to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to be oneself is to make the choices that best reflect the self, and these choices - taken cumulatively - are the expression and enactment of personality - and reflect back upon the person who has made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To behave in a way not in keeping with the identity that others have grown to recognize and love is to become unknowable to untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lifestyle choices often reveal our values, or at least what we&apos;d like people to perceive as our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we learn we&apos;re not as great as we thought we were, we can decide to change our behavior so that it aligns more with how we want to be perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice requires us to think more deeply about who we are, both within ourselves and in the eyes of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I choose to discover who I am.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If choice is about possibility, then it&apos;s also about responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More is less, more choice leads to less satisfaction or fulfillment or happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are consequences to keeping our options open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must increase our expertise in order to counteract the limits on our cognitive abilities and resources, enabling us to obtain the most benefit from our choices with the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s clear that we should concentrate our own expertise on those domains of choice that are most common and/or important to our lives, and those we actively enjoy learning about and choosing from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;limits the choices you can make and will make. Knowledge is always important where there&apos;s a choice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re reluctant to give up choice in any situation because we believe it enables us to change and shape our lives for the better; on the other hand, we recognize from experience and perhaps from intuition that some choices, no matter which option we choose and what the outcome, will always diminish our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can similarly choose to relinquish our difficult choices to others, which neatly avoids having to decide between the distress or harm that would result from choosing for ourselves and the diminished autonomy that would result from other&apos;s restricting our choices without our approval.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 5 Love Languages - The Secret To Love That Lasts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Words of Affirmation Quality Time Receiving Gifts Acts of Service Physical Touch People speak different love languages.

&lt;li&gt;Words of Affirmation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receiving Gifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts of Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People speak different love languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be willing to learn our spouse&apos;s primary love language if we are to be effective communicators of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Inside every child is an &apos;emotional tank&apos; waiting to be filled with love. When a child really feels loved, he will develop normally, but when the love thank is empty, the child will misbehave. Much of the misbehavior of children is motivated by the craving of an empty &apos;love tank&apos;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euphoria of the &quot;in-love&quot; state give us the illusion that we have an intimate relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Real love&quot; to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees in me something worth loving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbal compliments, or words of appreciation, are powerful communiactors of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latent potential within your spouse in his or her area of insecurity may await your encouraging words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse&apos;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mature love - love to which we aspire if we seek a growing marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is the way of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is an expression of love. &quot;I love you. I care about you, and I choose to forgive you. Even though my feelings of hurt may linger, I will not allow what has happened to come between us. I hope that we can learn from this experience. You are not a failure because you have failed. You are my spouse, and together we will go on from here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wish to love each other, we need to know what the other person wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the deepest human need is the need to feel apprecitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &quot;quality time,&quot; I mean giving someone your undivided attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes one person feel loved emotionally is not always the thing that makes another person feel loved emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality time means that we are doing something together and that we are going our full attention to the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality conversation mean sympathetic dialogue where two individual are sharing their experiences, thoughts, feelings, and desires in a friendly, uninterrupted context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relationship calls for sympathetic listening with a view to understanding the other person&apos;s thoughts, feelings, and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical presence in the time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if your spouse&apos;s primary love language is receiving gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act of service mean doing things you know your spouse would like you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one likes to be forced to do anything. In fact, love is always freely given. Love cannot be demanded. We can request things of each other, but we must never demand anything. Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is a choice and cannot be coerced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your spouse&apos;s love language is acts of service, then &quot;action speak louder than words.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical touch is a way of communicating emotional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three ways to discover your own primary love language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does your spouse do or fail to do that hurts you most deeply? The opposite of what hurts you most is probably your love language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you most often requested of your spouse? The thing you have most often requested is likely the thing that would make you feel most loved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what way do you regularly express love to your spouse? Your method of expressing love may be an inclication that would also make you feel loved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creature of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love doesn&apos;t erase the past, but it makes the future different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is something you do for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rise Of Superman - Decoding The Science Of Ultimate Human Performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[We all seem to agree genius begins with feats of mental greatness.

&lt;p&gt;Optimal performance is about being your best; ultimate performance is about being your best when any mistake could kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rare and radical state of consciousness where the impossible becomes possible. The zone, quite literally, is the shortest path toward superman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-risk activity can profoundly alter consciousness and significantly enhance mental abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindset impacts emotion, which alters biology, which increases performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every good athlete can find the flow, but it&apos;s what you do with it that makes you great. If you consistently use that state to do the impossible, you get confident in your ability to do the impossible. You begin to expect it. That&apos;s why we&apos;re seeing so much progression in action sports today. It&apos;s the natural result of a whole lot of people starting to expect the impossible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;During a peak experience, the individual experiences an expansion of self, a sense of unity, and meaningfulness in life. The experience lingers in one&apos;s consciousness and gives a sense of purpose, integration, self-determination and empathy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Flow states being so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. The ego falls away. Times flies. Every action, movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you&apos;re using your skills to the utmost.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all other activities, flow is the hallmark of high performance, but in situation where the slightest error could be fatal, then perfection is the only choice - and flow is the only guarantee of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the basic properties of flow: the profound mental clarity provided by the state; the emotional detachment that tends to accompany this clarity; and a hint of its automatic nature - how one right decision always leads to the next right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow packs a double punch: it doesn&apos;t just increase our decision-making abilities - it increases our creative decision-making abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voice - the voice of intuition - the center of the zone&apos;s mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow states significantly enhance performance: when the &quot;self&quot; disappears, it takes many of our limits along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is a fluid action state, making better decision isn&apos;t enough: we also have to act on those decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is the rush of possibility: a product of radical neurochemical, neuroelectric, and neuroanatomical function triggering whole-body transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we really want to be our best, we don&apos;t just have to rethink the path toward mastery; we need to reconsider the way we live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate well-structure practices is a rigorous, compliance-based approach to mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow doesn&apos;t just provide a joyful, self-directed path toward mastery - it literally shortens the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want more flow in our lives, the best place to start that investigation is with the people with the most flow in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&apos;re interested in mastery, you have to learn this lesson. To really achieve anything, you have to be able to tolerate and enjoy risk. It has to become a challenge to look forward to. In all fields, to make exceptional discoveries you need risk - you&apos;re just never going to have a breakthrough without it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To reach flow, one must be willing to take risks. The lover must lay bare his soul and risk rejection and humiliation to enter this state. The athlete must be willing to risk physical harm, even loss of life, to enter this state. The artist must be willing to be scorned and despised by critics and the public and still push on. And the average person - you and me - must be willing to fail, look foolish, and fall flat on our faces should we wish to enter this state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the brain is charged with a clear goal, focus narrows considerably, the unimportant is disregarded, and the now is all that&apos;s left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow channel - the spot where the task is hard enough to make us stretch but not hard enough to make us snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growth mindset is one of the secrets to maximizing the total amount of flow in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who participated in group flow were the highest performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow enhances creativity, the process of developing original ideas that have value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of autonomy the desire to direct your own life, mastery the desire to learn, explore, and be creative, and purpose the desire to matter, to contribute to the world are our most powerful intrinsic drivers - the three things that motivate us most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is long and we&apos;re all scared and, in flow, at least for a little while, we&apos;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When innovation leads to death, powerful tradition ensures that death leads to more innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is a creation engine: it helps us pluck an idea out of imagination and bring it fully formed into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After something has been done once, it becomes considerably easier to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we can actually see ourselves doing the impossible, our chance of pulling it off increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all see farther by standing on the shoulders of giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ability to learn faster than your competitors is the only sustainable competitive advantage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow brings out the very best in us - and for certain, it&apos;s that very best we&apos;ll need to create a world of abundance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Originals - How Non-Conformists Move The World Forward]]></title><description><![CDATA[Creative Destruction Originality involves introducing and advancing an idea that's relatively unusual within a particular domain, and that…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/originals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/originals/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;Creative Destruction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originality involves introducing and advancing an idea that&apos;s relatively unusual within a particular domain, and that has the potential to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and exploring whether a better option exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we become curious about the dissatisfying default in our world, we begin to recognize that most of them have social origins: Rules and systems were created by people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blind Inventors and One-Eyed Investors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to be over confident when we evaluate ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False positive: it was forecast as a hit but turned out to be a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False negative: it was expected to fail but ultimately flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people fail to achieve originality because they generate a few ideas and then obsess about refining them to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we gain knowledge about a domain, we become prisoners of our prototypes. The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crave acceptance by our peer group, those similar to us. We&apos;re also drawn to peer evaluations because they provide the most reliable judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be successfully original, an invention needs to be new - but it also has to be practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuition operates rapidly, based on hot emotions, whereas reason is a slower, cooler process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Out on a Limb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power involves exercising control or authority over others; status is being respected and admired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were punished for trying to exercise power without status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want people to accept our original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could do things over, most of us would censor ourselves less and express our ideas more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fools Rush In&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination might be conducive to originality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaying progress enabled people to spend more time considering different ways to accomplish it, rather than &quot;seizing and freezing&quot; on one particular strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination may be the enemy of productivity, but it can be a resource for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of &quot;genius sometimes accomplish most when they work the least, for they are thinking out inventions and forming in their minds the perfect idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeigarnik effect: people have a better memory for incomplete than complete tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Timing accounted for forty-two percent of the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving first is a tactic, not a goal, being the first mover doesn&apos;t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goldilocks and the Trojan Horse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feeling of strangeness and hostility between them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were a true believer, you&apos;d be all in. The more strongly you identify with an extreme group, the harder you seek to differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to inspire people, we should start with why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frenemies - people who sometimes support you and sometimes undermine you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cur our frenemies and attempt to convert our enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A person whose liking for us increases over time will be liked better than one who has always liked us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rebel with a Cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use the logic consequence, we can always find reasons not to take risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic of appropriateness free us up. We think less about what will guarantee the outcome we want, and act more on a visceral sense of what someone like us ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Firstborns are more risk averse than laterborns.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although firstborns tend to be more dominant, conscientious, and ambitious, laterborns are more open to taking risks and embracing original ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niche picking helps to solve the mystery of why siblings aren&apos;t terribly similar; laterborn children actively seek to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents of highly creative children outlined their standards of conduct and explained their grounding in a set of principles about right and wrong, referencing values like morality, integrity, respect, curiosity, and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character praise leaves a lasting imprint when identities are forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rethinking Groupthink&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupthink is the enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupthink occurs when people &quot;are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group,&quot; and their &quot;striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star blueprint focus on placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitment blueprint main priority was to employ people who matched the company&apos;s values and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong culture has a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they&apos;re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Minority viewpoint are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t let loyalty stand in the way of truth and openness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Argue like you&apos;re right and listen like you&apos;re wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You gain believability by other believable people saying you&apos;re believable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shapers&quot; are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rocking the Boat and Keeping It Steady&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic optimists anticipate the best, staying calm and setting high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defensive pessimists expect the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is marked by uncertainty about the future: We&apos;re worried that something bad will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originality brings more bumps in the road, yet it leaves us with more happiness and a greater sense of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world, indeed, it&apos;s the only thing that ever has.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Power Of Meaning - Finding Fulfillment In A World Obsessed With Happiness]]></title><description><![CDATA[Two paths to the good life.

The first is hedonia happiness. Human beings, &quot;strive after happiness; they want to become happy and to remain so.&quot; &quot;The art of life lies in taking pleasures as they pass, and the keenest pleasures are not intellectual, nor are they always moral.&quot; Meaning is the other path to the good life, the concept of eudaimonia, leading a eudaimonic life, requires cultivating the best qualities within you both morally and intellectually and living up to your potential. The distinction is hedonia is defined as &quot;feeling good,&quot; while eudaimonia is defined as &quot;being and doing good.&quot; Those who choose to pursue meaning untimely live fuller and happier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for meaning is for more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sources of meaning all around us, and by tapping into them, we can all lead richer and more satisfying lives and help others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness and unhappiness did not predict suicide. The variable that did was meaning or, more precisely, the lack of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people die for meaning: some kill themselves because they judge their lives to be worthless, while others sacrifice their lives for their ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life has no meaning a priori.... It&apos;s up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing but the meaning that you choose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs some &quot;thing,&quot; some project or goal, to which he chooses to dedicate his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by facing challenges head-on can we truly find meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning arises from transcending the self. &quot;A thing has significance only through its relation as part to a larger whole, then, thought we cannot give a metaphysical and universal meaning to all life in general, we can say of any life in particular that its meaning lies in relation to something larger than itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four pillars of meaning: belonging, purpose, storytelling, and transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to feel that we belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to find meaning in our own lives, we have to begin by reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose is a &quot;stable and far-reaching&quot; goal that involves a contribution to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A part of one&apos;s personal search for meaning, but it also has an external component, the desire to make a difference in the world, to contribute to matters larger than the self.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living purposefully requires self-reflection and self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are capable of something unique, each one of us, but it takes time to find out what that is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for individuals to live meaningful lives, they must cultivate the strengths, talents, and capacities that lie within them and use them for the benefit of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what occupies our days, when we reframe our tasks as opportunities to help others, our lives and our work feel more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories are particularly essential when it comes to defining our identity - understanding who we are and how we got that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are driven to contribute to society and to future generations, all share a common pattern: they are more likely to tell redemptive stories about their lives, or stories that transition from bad to good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning we derive from the experience stays with us, often for our entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can grow to lead deeper and more meaningful lives through adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not the actual trauma that is causing the change. It is how people interpret what happens, how what they believe about themselves and life and the world get shaken up, not the trauma itself, that forces people to experience growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating death can actually help us, if we have the proper mindset, to lead more meaningful lives and to be at peace when our final moment on earth arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salvation of man is through love and in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being human, always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Kaizen Way - One Small Step Can Change Your Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[When people want to change, they usually turn first to the strategy of innovation.

The problem with innovation, too often, you meet with success in the short term, only to find yourself falling back into your old ways when your initial burst of enthusiasm fades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative strategy is called kaizen - &quot;A journey of a thousand miles must begin with the first step.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaizen and innovation are the two major strategies people use to create change. Where innovation demands shocking and radical reform, all kaizen asks is that you take small, comfortable steps toward improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-key change helps the human mind circumnavigate the fear that blocks success and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet life&apos;s constant demands for change by seeking out continual - but always small - improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the steps may be small, what we&apos;re reaching for is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When life gets scary and difficult, we tend to look for solutions in places where it is easy or at least familiar to do so, and not in the dark, uncomfortable places where real solutions might lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use time of difficulty to remember that fear is the body&apos;s gift, alerting us to a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear tend to sort themselves into two major categories: the fear of not being worthy and the fear of losing control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you&apos;ll build the kaizen habit of asking yourself small and positive questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind sculpture, people imagine the movement of their muscles, and the rise and fall of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can train your brain by small increments to develop the new set of skills it needs to actually engage in this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it takes is one small step to affect a dramatic improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaizen asks us to be patient. It asks us to have faith that with small steps, we can better overcome the mind&apos;s initial resistance to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are trying to make a change, it can be tempting to ignore the subtle warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we face personal crises, the kaizen strategy of solving small problems offers consolation and practical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our lives are in great distress, even while we are feeling out of control or in emotional pain, we can try to locate the smaller problems within the larger disaster, and perhaps apply any or all of the kaizen techniques to move us slowly in the direction of a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small rewards are not only sufficient as an incentive to get a job done, but they are optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kaizen approach to life require a slower pace and an appreciation of small moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through kaizen, we can regain more of that precious quality of childhood: the ability to take pleasure in the moment, to become fascinated with those around us and whatever we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of kaizen: an optimistic belief in our potential for continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Will You Measure Your Life?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Their personal relationship had begun to deteriorate, even as their professional prospects blossomed.

&lt;p&gt;This is why theory can be so valuable: it can explain what will happen, even before you experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good theory help people steer to good decision - not just in business, but in life, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way a strategy can get implemented is if we dedicate resources to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentive theory: is that people work in accordance with how you pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation theory: true motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a job that you love and you&apos;ll never work a day in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipated opportunities - the opportunities that you can see and choose to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unanticipated - usually a cocktail of problems and opportunities that emerges while you are trying to implement the deliberate plan or strategy that you have decided upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To understand a company&apos;s strategy, look at what they actually do rather than what they say they will do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory of good money and bad money: When the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth but impatient for profit. But once a viable strategy has been found, investors need to change what they seek - they should become impatient for growth and patient for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The job to be done&quot;: what causes us to buy a product or service is that we actually hire products to do the jobs for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factors that determine what a company can and cannot do - it capabilities, are resources, processes, and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that even if you&apos;re doing it with the best of intentions, if you find yourself heading down a path of outsourcing more and more of your role as a parent, you will lose more and more of the precious opportunities to help your kids develop their values - which may be the most important capability of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children will learn when they&apos;re ready to learn, not when you&apos;re ready to teach them; if you are not with them as they encounter challenges in their lives, then you are missing important opportunities to shape their priorities - and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skills that leaders have - or lack - depends heavily on which &quot;courses,&quot; they have and have not taken along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their priorities need to be set correctly so they will know how to evaluate their options and make a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is a way of working together toward common goals that have been followed so frequently and so successfully that people don&apos;t even think about trying to do things another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture is the unique combination of processes and priorities within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions in your life is to never start making them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of person you want to become - what the purpose of your life is - is too important to leave to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunities and challenges in your life that allow you to become that person will, by their way very nature, be emergent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Outliers - The Story Of Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[Appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/outliers-the-story-of-success/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/outliers-the-story-of-success/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story line is always the same: our hero is born in modest circumstances and by virtue of his own grit and talent fights his way to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Effect: It is those who are successful, who are most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We overlook just how large a role society play in determining who makes it and who doesn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients of success at the highest level: passion, talent, and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10,000-hour rule: that the ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What truly distinguishes outliers is not their extraordinary talent but their extraordinary opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outliers were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If intelligence matters only up to a point, then pass that point, other things - things that have nothing to do with intelligence - must start to matter more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical intelligence: knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outliers from lowest social and economic class lack a community around them that prepared them properly for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful people don&apos;t do it alone. Where they come from matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success comes from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape the world to your desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Culture of honor&quot; means a world where a man&apos;s reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinary specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working really hard is what successful people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Way Of The Superior Man - A Spiritual Guide To Mastering The Challenges Of Women, Work, And Sexual Desire]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity, which is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles.

&lt;p&gt;If men and women are clinging to a politically correct sameness even in moments of intimacy, then sexual attraction disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feminine always seems chaotic and complicated from the perspective of the masculine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fearful man who knows he is fearful is far more trustable than a fearful man who isn&apos;t aware of his fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free man is free to acknowledge his fear, without hiding them, or hiding from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My deepest wisdom is leading me to this decision. If I am wrong, I will learn from it, and my wisdom will have deepened. I&apos;m willing to be wrong, and grow from it. I trust this process of acting from my deepest wisdom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to any particular relationship. If a man prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disserves the universe, and cheats his woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in your life, from your diet to your career, must be aligned with your purpose if you are to act with coherence and integrity in the world. If you know your purpose, your deepest desire, then the secret of success is to discipline your life so that you support your deepest purpose and minimize distractions and detours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can give love to your family and engage your life&apos;s work, if you discipline yourself to act on your deepest desires with priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good woman will love the childlike part of you, but she wants your life to be guided by your deepest truths, not your untended childhood wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A superior man: a man who does his best to live as love in the world and in his intimacy, a man whose heart remains open and whose truth remains strong even when his woman criticizes him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiva, the divine masculine: unperturbable, totally loving, fully present, and all-pervading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman will always test her man for the pleasure of feeling his strength in loving, his capacity to transcend nuisance, his persistence in his own truth, and his capacity to share that truth in love with her, even when she is complaining - especially when she is complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you listen to your woman, listen to her as you would the ocean, or the wind in the leaves. The sounds you hear from her are sounds of the motion of her feeling-energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;truth&quot; of the feminine is whatever she is really feeling, in this present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t believe the literal content of what your woman says unless love is flowing deeply and fully in the moment when she says it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want your woman to grow in her radiance, health, happiness, love, beauty, power, and depth, praise these qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of an intimacy is to serve each other in growth and love, hopefully in better ways than we can serve ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A superior man sees his woman&apos;s mood not as a curse, but as a challenge and an amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A happy woman is a woman relaxed in her body and heart: powerful, unpredictable, deep, potentially wild and destructive, or calm and serene, but always full of life, surrendered to and moved by the great force of her oceanic heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminine priority is the flow of love in relationship and masculine priority is purpose and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always help your woman make decisions by giving her your perspective and telling her your choices, while letting her know that you love her regardless of the decision she makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masculine men are attracted to forms of feminine energy: radiant women, beer, music, nature, etc. If a man tries to hide his attraction, it reveals some degree of shame with respect to his own sexual core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a man with a masculine sexual essence, you will always feel sexual polarity with anyone who animates feminine energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are always attracted to your sexual reciprocal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feminine body is free to be moved by love, and by life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what you get in a woman with a feminine sexual essence: A woman who is all over the place emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will only be happy in intimacy if you choose a woman who is your sexual reciprocal as a partner. And you will only be able to survive such an intimacy if her dark and light sides are equally embraceable to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To serve one another&apos;s enlightenment through your unwavering commitment to love, and to enliven one another&apos;s core by the bodily transmission of love via sexual polarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A superior man practices maintaining full consciousness in all situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath your woman&apos;s superficial request is her actual desire and need: she wants your passionate fullness to pervade her, she wants to be able to trust the unsinkability of your loving, she wants to feel in her bones that your divine masculine presence is stronger than your distractibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although your woman seems to want to be the most important thing in your life, she actually can trust and love you more if she is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To live free in spirit, you must be willing to face your fears and let go of anything that limits your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body, tone of voice, and the look in your eyes mean a lot more to her than anything you could say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows that if you are not free to meet her dark destructress energy and ravish her in love, you won&apos;t be free to meet the dark destructress of the world - who will challenge your spiritual freedom - with strength and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her gift, if she is a good woman, is to test you with her darkest moods, over and over and over, until your consciousness is unperturbed by feminine challenge, and you are able to pervade her with your love, just as you are here to pervade the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s true radiance reveals the degree to which she is open, trusting, connected, and loving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your lust reveals your real desire to unite with the feminine, to penetrate as deeply as possible, to receive her delicious light as radiant food for your masculine soul, and to give her your entirety, losing yourself in the giving, so that you are both liberated beyond your selves in the explosion of your gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose to engage the world and women fully, then you must maintain a certain degree of polarization or mutual attraction with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than deciding to move on because you are too weak to overcome your own neutralized lack of desire, try to take on the challenge of manifesting love in the dreary world and in your dreary woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ejaculation is not completely a matter of conscious choice for you, your woman knows she controls you sexually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction of growth of a relationship is primarily the man&apos;s responsibility. The energy of an intimacy - pleasure, sexual flow, and vitality - is primarily the woman&apos;s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your main gift in intimacy is to guide her, moment by moment, out of her moods and into the openness of loving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moment by moment, practice loving through your woman and the world, allowing the force of your surrender to transform every moment into an orgasm of divine dissolution. Embrace every moment of experience as a lover, and trust whatever direction love moves you. Die in the giving of your gift, so you don&apos;t even notice you have stopped holding onto yourself. Fear is your final excuse. Don&apos;t fight it. Love through it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 10x Rule - The Only Difference Between Success And Failure]]></title><description><![CDATA[In order to get to the next level of whatever you're doing, you must think and act in a wildly different way than you previously have been…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-10x-rule/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-10x-rule/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to get to the next level of whatever you&apos;re doing, you must think and act in a wildly different way than you previously have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is the degree of measure of attaining some desired object or end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the focus of the 10x Rule: You must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is an accumulation of events turning out well or desired outcomes being achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who limits his or her potential success will limit what he or she will do to create it and keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never reduce a target. Instead, increase actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, success is important, success is your duty, and there is no shortage of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must never reduce success in your mind or in a conversation to something that doesn&apos;t matter; on the contrary, it is vital!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating success as an option is one of the major reasons why more people don&apos;t create it for themselves - and why most people don&apos;t even get close to living up to their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fairly common for people who don&apos;t get what they want to provide justifications - and even lie to themselves - by minimizing how valuable success is to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The harder I work, the luckier I get.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success always comes as a result of earlier actions, no matter how seemingly insignificant they are or how long ago they were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success must be approached from an ethical viewpoint. Success is your duty, obligation, and responsibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success for anyone or any group is ultimately a positive contribution to all people and all groups as it provides validation of the possibilities to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is not something that happens to you; it&apos;s something that happens because of you and because of the actions you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get where you want to go in life, you must adopt the view that whatever is going on in your world - good, bad, or nothing - is something caused by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that happens in your life comes as a result of your own responsibility, not merely some outside force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start to approach every situation as someone who is acting - not being acted upon - you will start to have more control over your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing happens to me; it happens because of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which degree of action you operate in, they all require work in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t create new problems, then you&apos;re not taking enough action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t matter what you do - it does matter that your goals be to dominate your sector with actions, that are immediate, consistent, and persistent and at levels that no one else is willing to operate at or duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dominate your sector, your goal, dream, or ambition, you must first dominate your every interest, thought, and consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people make only enough effort for it to feel like work, whereas the most successful follow up every action with an obsession to see it through to a reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you become obsessed about the things you want; otherwise, you are going to spend a lifetime being obsessed with making up excuses as to why you didn&apos;t get the life you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not creating new problems for yourself, then you aren&apos;t taking enough action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcommit: be all in, and take massive level of action followed up by massive amount of more actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is actually a sign that you are doing what&apos;s needed to move in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That criticisms and complaints are inevitable indications that you are growing as you should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;re building a business, your primary target is not customer satisfaction yet; it is acquisition, referral, and loyalty and then more acquisition using the customers you&apos;ve attained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer acquisition is the primary target, followed by customer loyalty, followed by customers who spread the word about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your name is your most important asset.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnipresence - the goal of being everywhere at all times and at the same time - is exactly the kind of massive thinking that is missing from most people&apos;s expectation of themselves and their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your name, brand, and reputation are your most valuable assets only if enough people know of them and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuses are never the reason for why you did or didn&apos;t do something. They&apos;re just a revision of the facts that you make up in order to help yourself feel better about what happened or didn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it is to be, it is up to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one values a person who not only doesn&apos;t have the information but doesn&apos;t want to know the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fastest and best ways to separate yourself from the masses is to establish yourself as someone who makes situations better, not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do something big, you have to embrace danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of actual money - only shortage of people creating wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful people invest time, energy, and money in improving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your success is limited to the ability of those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to focus to some degree on now but keep most of your attention on the future you desire to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act now and then keep acting with the knowledge that enough actions taken now will create the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tiny Beautiful Things - Advice On Love And Life From Dear Sugar]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is what I got out of the book.

Part of life is living it day by day and we become who we are from our personal experience and surrounding environment. Life can be hard and unpredictable, but that&apos;s what makes it unique and fun. Remember we are not alone in this world, there&apos;s people who have gone through or is going through the same exact experience as you are at any given moment. Whenever you feel like you&apos;re in hell, remind yourself that others have been there and live to tell their story. All our experiences in life will make us stronger and wiser, it helps us see the light when we are blinded without the experience. Our life is unique to us and we always had the power to control where it takes us.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Head First Design Patterns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Strategy Pattern Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Principle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. In other words, take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program to an interface, not an implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favor composition over inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Observer Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand newspaper subscriptions, you pretty much understand that Observer Patter, only we call the publisher the &lt;strong&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/strong&gt; and the subscribers the &lt;strong&gt;OBSERVERS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Observer Pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled. When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Principle: Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Decorator Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Factory Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defines an interface for creating an object, but let’s subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Singleton Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Command Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Adapter Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn&apos;t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Facade Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle of Least knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Template Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm&apos;s structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Iterator Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Composite Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of object uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The State Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Proxy Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is a solution to a problem in a context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Anti-Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; tells you how to go from a problem to a BAD solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creational Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; involve object instantiation and all provide a way to decouple a client from the objects it needs to instantiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any pattern that is a &lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is concerned with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; let you compose classes or objects into larger structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; describe how relationships between classes are defined via inheritance. Relationships in class patterns are established at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; describe relationships between objects and are primarily defined by composition. Relationships in object patterns are typically created at runtime and are more dynamic and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Elite Way - 10 Rules Men Must Know In Order To Deal With Women]]></title><description><![CDATA[You must have self-imposed rules, rules for yourself that you will not compromise.

&lt;p&gt;GIC formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real confidence comes from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quitter is a person who gives up too easily because of a lack of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hater is a person who gives up too easily and who tries to project their lack of confidence and self-doubt onto others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major facet of gaining real confidence is trusting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real confidence is based on knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characteristic of a person with real confidence involves them deflecting attention away from themselves and putting the spotlight on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your game muscle is your mouth piece and your mouthpiece is your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but creatures of emotions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect is the foundation for every successful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a man, you have to own up to the things that happen to you in life. Even if something wasn&apos;t your fault, per se, you still have to acknowledge your own role in the outcome of the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never get into any situation where your respect and integrity is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten Tips for dealing with women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be true to the game / Don&apos;t try to trick or deceive women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept suggestion from women / But never take orders from women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the initiative / But don&apos;t act thirsty with women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be your own man / But don&apos;t seek validation from women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look women in the eye when you talk to them / But don&apos;t stare women down to where it&apos;s creepy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be entertaining / But never try to impress women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control yourself sexually / Never let women use sex as a bargaining chip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value yourself as a man / Don&apos;t place women on pedestals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make integrity the foundation of your game / Don&apos;t use money as the foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect women when it&apos;s earned / But never trust a Ho.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man&apos;s attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-status man displays non-neediness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her - you should be invested in her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What woman want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are attracted to a man they can respect, to a man they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to non-neediness is to have both: respect for both oneself and for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What woman want - what we all really want - is a strong, independent, non-needy partner who fulfills us, who we can share ourselves with and receive them in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: what you actually say doesn&apos;t matter, why you say it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True honesty is only possible when it is unconditional. The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift - when nothing is expected in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman&apos;s attention or affection through entertainment, money, or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-needy man does not seek to impose himself on the boundaries of others, he&apos;s merely interested in maintaining his own boundaries while respecting the boundaries of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons that prevent attracted women from being with you, and they are both quite common. Friction is when a woman finds you to be an attractive man, but there are value differences or external circumstance that prevent her from acting on that attraction or being interested in you. Projection are when women who, for whatever reason, are afraid of their own sexuality and/or openly sexual men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think other want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male attractiveness is based on how non-needy one is and how comfortable one is in expressing one&apos;s desire and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection exists for a reason - it&apos;s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who are Unreceptive are just that: they&apos;re unavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who are Receptive are woman who are sexually/romantically attracted to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success = Maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women we prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways in which we are honest. 1) living based on our value lifestyle; 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions boldness; and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Three Fundamentals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming your fear and anxiety will correlate with your overall results with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you play to your strengths - i.e., if you focus your time and energy on meeting women in situations where they are likely to share your values, interests, and needs - then you&apos;re going to not only experience a much higher degree of success, but you&apos;re going to meet women you enjoy a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you realize it or not, the results you get with women are always your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are attracted to your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two biggest factors on your appearance are Fashion and Fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules to dressing well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear clothes that fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear clothes that match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dress to your personality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only important &quot;skill&quot; in dating is learning how to stop buying into your own bullshit, to stop believing your own stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looking for: the man who can make her feel more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper way to handle your fear and your anxiety is to accept it, recognize that it&apos;s normal and a part of who you are, and to not event try to hide it from the woman you&apos;re meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-neediness means to feel the fear and not let it define you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to attack anxieties is through incremental, consistent exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater boldness leads to greater polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s no such thing as a man who is adored by women who isn&apos;t also creepy some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creepiness is behaving in a way that makes a woman feel insecure sexually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flirting is expressing your sexuality to a woman in a way that makes her feel secure expressing her sexually back towards you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueprint of seduction: a strong, high status, attractive exterior lifestyle and looks, fearless, and able to open up and shares your vulnerable side with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important rule of emotional connection is to relate to feeling, not facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact words you say are far less important than your intentions and level of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold reading is a skill where you&apos;re able to intuitively &quot;know&quot; something about someone else without actually knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are talking to a woman there are only two real subjects of conversation: her and you. Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a connecting requires three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being open about yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting her to be open about herself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relating to each other&apos;s experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using texting to organize a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting physical with women, and getting physical quickly and comfortably, is ultimately the difference between having a lot of female friends, and having a lot of girlfriends and dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the courtship process, it&apos;s always the man&apos;s responsibility to take action and make the moves, and the woman&apos;s responsibility to give him signals, telling him when to proceed and when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you can kiss her, you probably could have ten minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Being The Strong Man A Woman Wants - Timeless Wisdom On Being A Man]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you don't lead, I can't dance.

She wants…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/being-the-strong-man-a-woman-wants/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/being-the-strong-man-a-woman-wants/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t lead, I can&apos;t dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A woman wants to admire and look up to her man, but she doesn&apos;t want him to look down on her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to admire and look up to you. She wants you to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants a man who knows what he wants. The irony is, if you&apos;re just always trying to please her, you don&apos;t really please her at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Spock said that if a father &quot;is to have an ideal influence on his children as well as a good relationship with his wife, he must be first of all a father, which means being a leader of and a model for his children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being strong isn&apos;t easy. It&apos;s taking responsibility for what&apos;s going on, taking charge and find solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to hurt your wife&apos;s feelings, but if you&apos;re always led by her advice without using your own judgement, life can become hell. She may lead you to do something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re worthy, the woman will be a helper, if you&apos;re not worthy, she will be against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s up to you to make things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you believe you&apos;re entitled to being treated well, you won&apos;t accept anything less. If you wait until things are very bad, it means you&apos;re set the limit too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop blaming others. Take full responsibility for changing the situation. The only person&apos;s behavior you can change is your own. Realize that she responds to what you do or don&apos;t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she oppose you, she may be testing to see if you&apos;re strong and know what you want. It&apos;s an opportunity to push yourself to grow as a person. The bigger the challenge, the more you&apos;re pushed to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being manly means having high moral standards, being self-disciplined, being decisive, having strength in your convictions, being honest and having the courage to face difficulties. It&apos;s being confident and self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Love and giving come together.&quot; People develop feeling of love for those to whom they give. Problems often begin when people go from being givers to being takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what you want to accomplish and plan how you&apos;re going to get there. Talk about each other&apos;s goals. They give purpose that can keep a couple together in hard times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&apos;t care how much you know until they know how much you care. When you take an interest in someone&apos;s life, that person feels you care and is often more willing to listen to your guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think before you do anything. Don&apos;t just react and follow your emotions. Anticipate situations and plan how to handle them calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting angry damages you and other people. It shows you don&apos;t know how to handle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you avoid making decisions - by letting other decide or by delaying until the decision makes itself - she may feel you&apos;re avoiding your responsibilities. Being strong means stepping forward to make decisions in difficult situations and taking responsibility for the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch men who are strong. Watch how they take charge. Become friends with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who is truly wealthy is the person who is content with what he has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Who is truly rich? A man married to a wife whose ways are pleasant, who doesn&apos;t demand a lot of material things and who along with her husband appreciates what they have.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if a man has a lot of money and his wife has many servants, she should not be idle, without work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No More Mr. Nice Guy! - A Proven Plan For Getting What You Want In Love, Sex, And Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Nice Guys believe that if they are good, giving, and caring, they will in return be happy, loved, and fulfilled.

&lt;p&gt;Nice Guy Syndrome - a belief that if Nice Guys are &quot;good&quot;, they will be loved, get their needs met, and live a problem-free life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being integrated means being able to accept all aspects of one&apos;s self. An integrated man is able to embrace everything that makes him unique: his power, his assertiveness, his courage, and his passion as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, and his dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome is dependent on revealing one&apos;s self and receiving support from safe people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To children, abandonment means death and they are ego-centered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic shame is the belief that one is inherently bad, defective, different, or unlovable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Nice Guys internalized the same belief - it was a bad or dangerous thing for them to be just who they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you keep doing what you&apos;ve always done, you&apos;ll keep getting what you&apos;ve always had.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By trying to please everyone, Nice Guys often end up pleasing no one - including themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking women&apos;s approval gives women the power to define men and determine their worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is actually a person&apos;s rough edges and human imperfections that gives other something to connect with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeking external validation and avoiding disapproval, recovering Nice Guys must begin seeking their own approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking good care of the self is essential for changing one&apos;s belief about the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending extended time alone is an important process in recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome. When alone, Nice Guys can discover who they are, what they like about themselves, and what rules they choose to govern their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caretaking is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one&apos;s need met. Focusing on another&apos;s problems, needs, or feelings in order to feel valuable, get one&apos;s own needs met, or to avoid dealing with one&apos;s own problems or feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Nice Guys learned to sacrifice themselves in order to survive, recovery must center on learning to put themselves first and making their needs a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal power as a state of mind in which a person is confident he can handle whatever may come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect of reclaiming personal power and getting what one wants in love and life is surrender. This means letting go of what one can&apos;t change and changing what one can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrender allows recovery Nice Guys to see each life experience as a &quot;gift&quot; from the universe to stimulate growth, healing, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Nice Guys often profess a deep desire to be intimately connected with another individual, their internalized toxic shame and childhood survival mechanisms make such connections difficult and problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intimacy - &quot;knowing the self, being known by another, and knowing another.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enmeshing Nice Guy makes his partner his emotional center, he will do whatever it takes to make her happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The avoiding Nice Guy seems to put his job, hobby, parents, and everything else before his primary relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice Guys will change the way they have relationships by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve of themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put themselves first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reveal themselves to safe people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate covert contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for their own needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dwell in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express their feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace their masculinity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have one obviously wounded person in a relationship, you always have two. No exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter relationships with a healthy agenda, find the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual assertiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment to personal growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Nice Guys have shame and fear about being sexual and about being sexual beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sex consists of two people taking full responsibility for meeting their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-respect, courage, and integrity look good on a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their core, all Nice Guys believe they are not important or good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a life, you want involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conscious decision to face fears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conscious decision to not settle for mediocrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conscious decision to make my own rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing stopping you from having the kind of life you really want is you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it frightens you, do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t settle. Every time you settle, you get exactly what you settled for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put yourself first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter what happens, you can handle it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do, do it one hundred percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are the only person on this planet responsible for your needs, wants, and happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If what you are doing isn&apos;t working, try something different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be clear and direct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to say &quot;no.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t make excuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are an adult, you are old enough to make your own rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let people help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not let anyone treat you badly, No one. Ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove yourself from a bad situation instead of waiting for the situation to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t tolerate the intolerable - ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop blaming. Victims never succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live with integrity. Decide what feels right to you, then do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the consequences of your actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be good to yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think &quot;abundance.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face difficult situations and conflict head on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t do anything in secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to let go of what you have so you can get what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun, if you are not having fun, something is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give yourself room to fail. There are no mistakes, only learning experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control is an illusion. Let go. Let life happen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many women prefer to be with a man who isn&apos;t afraid to stand up to them, who challenges them, and refuses to be pushed around when a woman tests him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she&apos;s more concerned about on a deep, primal level is: &quot;Are you man enough to lead and love me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more secure a woman feels around you the less she&apos;s going to test you in order to gain reassurance of your congruence or commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more attraction a woman feels for you the more she&apos;s going to test you in order to experience playful display of your masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must learn to embrace rejection and enjoy conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman tests you, she wants to establish your quality as a man, how will you perform in certain situation in the future, and whether or not she can rely on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-quality woman learns very quickly that the path to future relationship bliss is highly dependent on a man&apos;s ability to stand up for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A congruence test determines whether or not a man is, at his core, congruent with what he&apos;s presenting to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman use compliance tests to figure out how compliant a man is with her needs and wants as opposed to his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women use commitment tests to gain some assurance on the level of a man&apos;s commitment to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a man &apos;in control&apos; means that you are able to display grace under pressure while in the midst of difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your frame is a set of self-beliefs that determine how you define the outside world in relation to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men who always give women what they want and who let them get away with bad behavior are repulsive to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She needs to be convinced that you&apos;re convinced that you&apos;re the one wearing the pants in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By cowering in fear of her emotions you&apos;re actually signaling to her that she possesses the authority in the relationship and that you&apos;ll do just about anything to avoid her wrath, sadness, moodiness, or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to a man can tell if he wears the pants in his relationship or not is how he interacts with his woman when he knows without a shadow of a doubt that she won&apos;t approve of his words or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a woman&apos;s emotional state determines how honest you are you&apos;re not living your life by your principles, you&apos;re living it based on her approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong masculine man follows through with the truth no matter the consequences and he&apos;s willing to suffer pain for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To respond with masculine strength means you&apos;re responding from YOUR core values, standards, and beliefs, not hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to your guns is an idiom that means you refuse to compromise or change, despite criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must ask yourself, &quot;Am I acting like a man of integrity or am I being conflict-avoidant like a frightened child who thinks he&apos;s in trouble?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wise man knows when to remain steadfast and when to change his course in order to benefit not just himself, but those under his care as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love men who are certain that they&apos;re going to get exactly what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict crafts a man&apos;s character; therefore, avoiding it entirely won&apos;t make you any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important for a man to understand the difference between living based on his principles and living based on a woman&apos;s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man spends most of his time trying to do everything he thinks a woman wants him to do, he&apos;s already failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a mindset that there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; in how you interact with your woman is powerful because it set you free from trying to please her every time you relate with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a man, you must define your standards and then train your woman to respect the way you do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, a quality woman wants your honesty even if it does reveal your discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, for a man to display true strength he needs to be honest with how much he&apos;s willing to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be honest with what you&apos;re willing to tolerate and be willing to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must forgive but you must also set strong boundaries and assert yourself. Be a man of poise and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make better decisions in your interactions with women, master your own emotions so that you never find yourself afraid of hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman wants a man who leads with compassion and who loves with passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships are meant to be a place of healing and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ONLY way you can tell if a woman is comfortable and open to letting you lead her is the man whose authority she can submit to is by setting your own boundaries with her and refusing to engage her on her terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quality woman is more than willing to stand by her man through thick and thin so long as he&apos;s already proven himself as being worthy of her support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus your energy on becoming a strong, self-assured man at your core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice Guys, male doormats, and conflict-avoidant men are petrified of being &quot;misunderstood&quot; or disliked, especially by women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framing, the awareness that the most sacred thing about a man is the integrity of his own mind. It&apos;s the notation that a man must have such a strong conviction of his core values that nothing in his external environment can shake him or his self-belief or remove him from his path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop rock-solid self-belief by becoming a better man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, in order for a man to fully loving a woman he must overcome his fear of her emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman want to be loved by a man who leads. Any effort to seduce her or win her heart with romance will only backfire if she doesn&apos;t already respect you as a man.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus - The Classic Guide To Understanding The Opposite Sex]]></title><description><![CDATA[Men often complain, she is over-reacting and women complain, he doesn't listen!

&lt;p&gt;Only when we do not understand one another is there tension, resentment, or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When men and women are able to respect and accept their differences then love has a chance to blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man&apos;s sense of self is defined through his ability to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To offer a man unsolicited advice is to presume that he doesn&apos;t know what to do or that he can&apos;t do it on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A women&apos;s sense of self is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, when a woman offers unsolicited advice or tries to &quot;help&quot; a man, she has no idea of how critical and unloving she may sound to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, a woman just wants to share her feelings about her day, and her husband, thinking he is helping, interrupts her by offering a steady flow of solutions to her problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our partner resists us, it is probably because we have made a mistake in our timing or approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To feel better Martians, go to their caves to solve problems alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To feel better Venusians, get together and openly talk about their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman under stress is not immediately concerned with finding solutions to her problems but rather seeks relief by expressing herself and being understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To forget her own painful feelings a woman may become emotionally involve in the problems of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a man is fulfilled through working out the intricate details of solving a problem, a woman is fulfilled through talking about the details of her problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed... Women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the opportunity to prove his potential, a man expresses his best self. Only when he feels he cannot succeed does he regress back to his old selfish ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be needed is a slow death for a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s tendency to be compulsive relaxes as she remembers that she is worthy of love - she doesn&apos;t have to earn it; she can relax, give less, and receive more. She deserves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she wakes up and remembers her needs, he also wakes up and wants to give her more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man&apos;s deepest fear is that he is not good enough or that he is incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as women are afraid of receiving, men are afraid of giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for a man to listen to a woman when she is unhappy or disappointed because he feels like a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one complaint women have in relationships is: &quot;I don&apos;t feel heard.&quot; Even this complaint is misunderstood by men!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for women is correctly to interpret and support a man when he isn&apos;t talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man is silent it is easy for a woman to imagine the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent a man loses himself through connecting with his partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man grows to understand his own cycles and reassures her when he pulls away that he will be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&apos;s self-esteem rises and falls like a wave. When she hits bottom it is a time for emotional house cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relationships, men pull back and then get close, while women rise and fall in their ability to love themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when a man is succeeding in supporting a woman she may become even more upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When negative feelings are suppressed positive feelings become suppressed as well, and love dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men argue for the right to be free while women argue for the right to be upset. Men want space while women want understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By supporting her need to be heard she could support his need to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It puts too much pressure on a man to make him the only source of love and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a woman&apos;s financial needs are fulfilled she becomes more aware of her emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men primarily need trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women primarily need caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of empowering a man is never to try to change him or improve him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to help a man grow is to let go of trying to change him in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as communication is the most important element in a relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men rarely say &quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot; because on Mars it means you have done something wrong and you are apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most arguments escalate when a man begins to invalidate a women&apos;s feelings and she responds to him disapprovingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common way women unknowingly start arguments is by not being direct when they share their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most arguments occur not because two people disagree but because either the man feels that the women disapproves of his point of view or the woman disapproves of the way he is talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are most prone to argue when they have made a mistake or upset the women they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman keep score, no matter how big or small a gift or love is, it scores one point; each gift has equal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men strive for greater and greater success because they believe it will make them worthy of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man has made a mistake and feels embarrassed, sorry, or ashamed, then he needs her love more... The bigger the mistake, the more points he gives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man is in a negative state, treat him like a passing tornado and lie low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response Letters are the best way to teach a man about a women&apos;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of a relationship is solely dependent on two factors: a man&apos;s ability to listen lovingly and respectfully to a woman&apos;s feelings, and a woman&apos;s ability to share her feeling in a loving and respectful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the very act of avoiding our negative emotions give them the power to control our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grow in our ability to love ourselves we need to receive love as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Venus, their motto is &quot;Love is never having to ask!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a woman is not asking for support a man assumes he is giving enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man hears a demanding tone, not matter how nicely you phrase your request, all he hears is that he is not giving enough. His tendency is then to give less until you appreciate what he is already giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asking a man for support, assume that he doesn&apos;t have to be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are much more willing to say yes if they have the freedom to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask a man for support and you do not reject him for saying no, he will remember that, and next time he will be much more willing to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man grumbles, it is a good sign - he is trying to consider your request versus his needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements of assertive asking is to remain silent after you have asked for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are happiest when they feel they have succeeded in fulfilling the people they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradox: because you feel safe with your partner, your deepest fears have a chance to surface. When they surface you become afraid and are unable to share what you feel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Women Want In A Man - How To Become The Alpha Male Women Respect, Desire, And Want To Submit To]]></title><description><![CDATA[Masculine Chivalry: It is the sense of duty that a man feels deep within himself to become his best so that he can give his best and feel…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/what-women-want-in-a-man/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/what-women-want-in-a-man/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Masculine Chivalry: It is the sense of duty that a man feels deep within himself to become his best so that he can give his best and feel satisfied that he is doing his best. He doesn&apos;t NEED to be approved, praised, or rewarded by weakness while helping to rid the world of all that causes pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing that a woman wants from a man is the experience of feeling like a woman. She wants to lose herself in her feminity, and the only way she can feel this feminine experience is when a man acts like a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become secure in your ability to make intelligent decisions in the face of conflict, and become a master at handling your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No good woman in her RIGHT mind wants to be with a Mr. Nice-Guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn the art of disappointing people and putting your needs first into a practice. In other words, make a discipline, a ritual, a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become comfortable telling people &quot;No&quot;, and hearing &quot;No&quot; from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t feel secure within yourself, no woman will feel secure with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m committed to being a successful man, but not at the expense of my health, meaningful relationships, my morals, and the well-being of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I refuse to suffer.&quot; I remind myself that as a man I choose not to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You being fearful is not going to help ANYONE in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does this add value to my life?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember, garbage in, garbage out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she&apos;s subconsciously trying to figure out is: When the time comes, can this guy meet my deepest sexual needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a MAN and you have needs, such as sex. She is a woman and she has needs, such as YOUR DESIRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am in control of my emotions. I am self-confident and self-assured, and I make excellent decisions. I am a fearless man with immense poise and power.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your path in life and be determined to stay on that path no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman are attracted to men who illustrate the traits and qualities of leadership. A good woman will choose to follow and trust a man who is consciously following the path of leadership. Her love, respect, and desire for him will continue to grow so long as he can captivate her mind, body, and soul by making her an irreplaceable partner in his own grand adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always take ownership of the truth that your life is whatever you make of it, past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to master your fears, you must master your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge yourself consciously and consistently every single day of your life. This will build the most important characteristic found in ALL great leaders and highly successful individuals of society. It will build your courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You MUST learn how to accept yourself for who you are and for where you are in life beginning today. Even though your mission as a mature man is to constantly evolve and reach your highest potential, if you fail to accept yourself and find contentment in your present stage of development you won&apos;t be effective in becoming the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivate the habit of being grateful for your life just as it is today, and how you&apos;d like it to be in the future. Make it a HABIT to see the positive side of things, and develop an optimistic disposition towards life. Show your gratitude in how you live your life and EXPECT good things to happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t be afraid to get good advice that can help you to improve yourself and your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Powerful Lessons In Personal Change]]></title><description><![CDATA[We must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main categories for maps: maps of the way things are or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we see things is the source of the way we think and the way we act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the world, not as it is, but as we are - or, as we conditioned to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paradigms, correct or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening involves patience, openness, and the desire to understand - highly developed qualities of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build inner character first, private victory before public victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Common sense isn&apos;t always common practice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;leadership is communicating other&apos;s worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn and not to do is really not to learn. To know and not do is really not to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is character that communicates most eloquently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Inside-out&quot; means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self - with your paradigms, your character, and your motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sow a thought and you reap an action; sow an act and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap a character; sow a character and you reap a destiny.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependence is the paradigm of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independence is the paradigm of I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdependent is the paradigm of we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private victories precede public victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques and skills that really make a difference in human interaction are the ones that almost naturally flow from a truly independent character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we become independent - proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organized and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity - we then can choose to become interdependent - capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we truly love others without condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity, and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about transactional to transformational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 1: Be Proactive&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habit of proactivity. It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility - the ability to choose your response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one can hurt you without your consent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is a verb. Love is something you do; the sacrifices you make, the giving of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working on ourselves instead of worrying about conditions, we were able to influence the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control problems involving our own behavior; indirect control problems involving other people&apos;s behavior; or no control problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct control problems problems involving our own behavior are solved by working on our habits. These are the &quot;Private Victories&quot; of Habit 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indirect control problems problems involving other people&apos;s behavior are solved by changing our methods of influence. These are the &quot;Public Victories&quot; of Habit 4, 5, and 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lord, give me the courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commitments we make and keep to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not what other do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most, it is our response to those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is here that we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. We can make a promise - and keep it. Or we can set a goal - and work to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your definition of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Begin with the end in mind.&quot; is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There&apos;s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit 1 say, &quot;You are the creator.&quot; Habit 2 is the first creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit 2 is based on principle of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s two parts, personal leadership first creation and management second creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my memory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past. I can become my own first creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a personal mission statement focusing on what you want to be &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; and to do &lt;strong&gt;contributions and achievements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the ability to change is changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle of Influence is the center of our life and will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victory over self is the foundation for rich, interdependent relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By centering our lives on correct principles, we create a solid foundation for development of security, guidance, wisdom, and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your paradigm is the source from which your attitudes and behavior flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meaning comes from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of the principle of our own growth enables us to search out correct principles with the confidence that the more we learn, the more clearly, we can focus the lens through which we see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 3: Put First Things First&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit 3 is the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management: organize and execute around priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management has two factors that define an activity are urgent and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant II not urgent but important is the heart of effective personal management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80 precent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy of the &quot;best&quot; is often the &quot;good&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management follows leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective management is putting first things first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize and execute around priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of effective personal management is to deal with things that are not urgent, but are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting Goals for Each Role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Adapting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is the highest form of human motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective interdependence can only be built on a foundation of true independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-mastery and self-discipline are the foundation of good relationships with other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but what we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we become independent, proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organize and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity. We then can choose to become interdependent, capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and repairing relationships are long-term investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we truly love others without condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity, and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 4: Think WIN-WIN&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you step from independence into interdependence in any capacity, you step into a leadership role. You are in a position of influencing other people. And the habit of effective interpersonal leadership is Think Win/Win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seek mutual benefit in all human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win/Win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It&apos;s not your way or my way; it&apos;s a better way, a higher way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win/Win or No Deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything less than Win/Win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stronger you are. The more genuine your character, the higher your level of proactivity, the more committed you really are to Win/Win. The more powerful your influence will be with that other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win/Win is a paradigm of human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win/Win comes from a character of integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek first to understand, then to be understood. This principle is the key to effective interpersonal communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To influence me, you first need to understand me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real key to your influence is your character or the kind of person you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you&apos;re influenced by my uniqueness. I&apos;m not going to be influenced by your advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to build the skills of empathic listening on a base of character that inspires openness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to have influence, you have to be influenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;empathic listening means listening with intent to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it&apos;s that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to good judgement is understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time you invest to deeply understand the people you love brings tremendous dividends in open communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you listen, you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek first to understand. Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, before you try to present your own ideas - seek to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we really, deeply understand each other, we open the door to creative solutions and third alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 6: SYNERGIZE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy is the essence of principle-centered leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It catalyzes, unifies, and unleashes the greatest powers within people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy means that the whole is greater than the sum of its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of synergy is to value differences - to respect them, to build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy - the mental, the emotional, the psychological difference between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you communicate synergistically, you are simply opening your mind and heart and expressions to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy effectiveness in an independent reality, it is teamwork, team building, the development of unity and creativity with other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds of other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s almost always a third alternative, and if you work with a Win/Win philosophy and really seek to understand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for everyone concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about renewing the four dimensions of your nature - physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most powerful investment we can ever make in life, investment in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mindfulness - An Eight-Week Plan For Finding Peace In A Frantic World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mindfulness is about observation without criticism; being compassionate with yourself.

&lt;p&gt;When you start to feel a little sad, anxious or irritable, it&apos;s not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort of trying to free yourself from a bad mood or out of unhappiness - of working out why you&apos;re unhappy and what you can do about it - often makes things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s ok to stop treating sadness and other difficulties as problems that need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are &quot;bundles&quot; of thoughts, raw feelings, bodily sensations and impulses. This is what emotions are; they&apos;re like a background color that&apos;s created when your mind fuses together all of your thoughts, feelings, impulses and bodily sensations to conjure up an overall guiding theme or state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear; brooding is the problem, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your perspective can transform your experience of life, but if you rely solely on outside circumstances changing in order to feel happy and energized, you&apos;ll have to wait a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being mode: You can change your internal landscape the mindscape irrespective of what&apos;s happening around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindful awareness - or mindfulness - spontaneously arises out of this Being mode when we earn to pay attention, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgement, to things as they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very foundation of mindful awareness: waking up to what&apos;s happening inside of you, and in the world, moment by moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaningful work, whether paid or unpaid, is a surefire way of boosting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Train yourself to notice when your autopilot is taking over, so that you can then make a choice about what you want your mind to be focusing upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relearn how to bring awareness to everyday activities so that you can see life as it is, unfolding moment by moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us can control what thoughts rampage through our minds, or the &quot;weather&quot; they can create. But we do have some control over how we relate to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily spend so much time &quot;in our head&quot; that we almost forget we have a body at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cultivate mindfulness truly, we need to become fully integrated with our body once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is looking at the same things with different eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do things in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you there by activate the mind&apos;s &quot;approach&quot; system: your life has a chance to become richer, warmer, more flexible and more creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is about reorienting your life, so you can enjoy it to the full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t have to change much of what you do from day to day, but instead learn to do the same things differently; to surround your tasks with the fresh air of awareness and choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts are like rumors in the mind. They might be true, but then again, they might not be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all stumbling through life trying to find happiness and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny actions can fundamentally alter your relationship to the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday life offers endless opportunities for you to stop, to focus, to remind yourself to be fully awake and present to what is happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice as if your life depended on it, as in many ways, it surely does. For then you will be able to live the life you have - and live it as if it truly mattered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 5 Elements Of Effective Thinking]]></title><description><![CDATA[Remember: Extraordinary people are just ordinary people who are thinking differently and that could be you. 1. EARTH: Grounding Your…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-5-elements-of-effective-thinking/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/the-5-elements-of-effective-thinking/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Remember: Extraordinary people are just ordinary people who are thinking differently and that could be you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;1. EARTH: Grounding Your Thinking - Understand Deeply&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every return to the basics will deepen your understanding of the entire subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the going gets tough, creative problem solvers create an easier, simpler problem that they can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you &quot;see&quot; and issue or &quot;understand&quot; a concept, be conscious of the lens through which you&apos;re viewing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see - no matter how mundane or obvious - rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don&apos;t know forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding simple things deeply means mastering the fundamental principles, ideas, and methods that then create a solid foundation on which you can build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2. FIRE: Igniting Insight through Mistakes - Fail to Succeed&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have the healthier attitude that failure is a potent teacher and a scheduled stop along the road to success, then we find ourselves liberated to move forward sooner, because mistakes are action we definitely can take at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you face a daunting challenge, think to yourself, &quot;In order for me to resolve this issue, I will have to fail nine times, but on the tenth attempt, I will be successful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow work to grow and evolve through iteratively identifying and improving on previous drafts and missteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes present a great opportunity to learn and improve, but action is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at a mistake not as a wrong answer, but instead as an opportunity to ask, &quot;What is the question to which this is a correct answer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is willing to fail is someone who is willing to step outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3. AIR: Creating Question out of Thin Air - Be Your Own Socrates&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating question is as important as answering them, if not more so, because framing good questions focuses your attention on the right issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get more out of what you hear or see, force yourself to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With practice, you can learn to take personal responsibility to understand what is being said as it happens in real time, and to actively construct well-founded question about what is missing, what is assumed, what might be extended, or what is vague or unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the goal of education should be to develop critical thinking and communication skills and other such mind - strengthening abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;4. WATER: Seeing the Flow of Ideas - Look Back, Look Forward&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New ideas today are built on the ideas of yesterday and illuminate the way the brilliant ideas of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand a more advanced topic, look back to see what brought you to where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you learn a new concept or master a skill, think about what extensions, variations, and applications are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must get in the habit of seeing each advance as putting us on the lower slope of a much higher peak that has yet to be scaled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;5. THE QUINTESSENTIAL ELEMENT: Engaging Change - Transform Yourself&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to change you into someone who thinks and learns better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the way to happiness, the path to change is not through greater willpower and harder work, but rather through thinking differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t be afraid to change any part of yourself, you&apos;ll still be there, only better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ability to change is part of who you are, then you are liberated from worry about weaknesses or defects, because you can adapt and improve whenever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what your stage in life, you are going to develop strength you do not yet have, and when you do, opportunities will open to you that you have not yet dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether in school or out, whether young or old, you can choose to be a person who sees boundless opportunities, who enjoys the lifelong process of personal growth and discovery, and who meets challenges and obstacles with innovation and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quiet - The Power of Introverts In A World That Can't Stop Talking]]></title><description><![CDATA[Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling.

We perceive…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/quiet/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/quiet/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling. Extroverts to the external life of people and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We perceive talkers as smarter than quiet types: even though grade-point averages and SAT and intelligence test scores reveal this perception to be inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Bus to Abilene&quot; anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate action, any action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introvert leader are quiet, humble, modest, reserved, shy, gracious, mild mannered, self-effacing, and understated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extroverts are better with passive employee while introverts are better with proactive employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social situations, introverts are more likely to hear and implement suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most inventors and engineers I’ve met are like me — they’re shy and they live in their heads. They’re almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone — best outside of corporate environments, best where they can control an invention’s design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other committee. I don’t believe anything really revolutionary has ever been invented by committee… I’m going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone… Not on a committee. Not on a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wozniak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can learn from: introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude can be a catalyst for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when you&apos;re alone that you can engage in Deliberate Practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influence and personal experience are thrown into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High reactivity is one biological basis of introversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to believe that we - as adults - can shape ourselves and make what we will of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can stretch our personalities, but only up to a point. Our inborn temperament influences us, regardless of the lives we lead. A sizable part of who are is ordained by our genes, by our brains, by our nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have free will and can use it to shape our personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reward sensitive person is highly motivated to seek rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introvert also seem to be better than extroverts at delaying gratification, a crucial life skill associated with everything from higher SAT scores and income to lower body mass index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow often occurs when people become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up. You enjoy relative freedom from the temptations of superficial prizes like money and status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk is for communicating need-to-know information; quiet and introspection are signs of deep thought and higher truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man has many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-monitors are highly skilled at modifying their behavior to the social demands of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three key steps to identifying your own core personal project. First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to. Finally, pay attention to what you envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who tend to suppress their negative emotion regularly might start to see the world in a more negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Five traits: Introversion - Extroversion; Agreeableness; Openness to Experience; Conscientiousness; and Emotionality Stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introverts desperately craving downtime and understanding from their partners, the extroverts longing for company, and resentful that others seemed to benefit from their partner&apos;s &quot;best&quot; selves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lying]]></title><description><![CDATA["white" lie: those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfort.

They tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining that they are being good in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endless forms of suffering and embarrassment could be easily avoided by simply telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speak truthfully is to accurately represent one&apos;s beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent to communicate honestly is the measure of truthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that trust is deeply rewarding and that deception and suspicion are two side of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest people are a refuge: You know they mean what they say; you know they will not say one thing to your face and another behind your back; you know they will tell you when they think you have failed and for this reason their praise cannot be mistaken for mere flattery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding, these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs, whether or not our lies are ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False encouragement is a kind of theft: It steal time, energy, and motivation that a person would put toward some other purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest problems for the liar is that he must keep track of his lies. When you tell the truth, you have nothing to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lie is to erect a boundary between the truth we are living and the perception others have of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The World Beyond Your Head - On Becoming An Individual In An Age Of Distraction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Attention is treated as a resource, a person has only so much of it.

&lt;p&gt;Attention is the thing that is most one&apos;s own: in the normal course of things, we choose what to pay attention to, and in a very real sense this determines what is real for us; what is actually present to our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attention is directed to a world that is shared; one&apos;s attention is not simply one&apos;s own, for the simple reason that its objects are often present to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes the successful children is the ability to strategically allocate their attention so that their actions aren&apos;t determined by the wrong thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to direct our attention where we will, we become more receptive to those who would direct our attention where they will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this unique tendency to want to justify ourselves, and construct a narrative that conveys the considerations that made an action seem choice-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts &quot;constantly re-arrange items to make it easy to 1. track the task; 2. figure out, remember, or notice the properties signaling what to do next; 3. predict the effect of actions.&quot; Experts make things easier for themselves by &quot;partially jigging or informationally structuring the environment as they go along.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you perceive is determined by what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perceiving is a way of acting. Perception is not something that happens to us, or in us. It is something we do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is known to us because we live and act in it, and accumulate experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we act is not determined in an isolated moment of choice; it is powerfully ordered by how we perceive the situation, how we are attuned to it, and this is very much a function of our previous history of shaping ourselves to the world in a particular way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perceived risk increases conscious effort and focuses attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of those engineering efforts offers good evidence that we are indeed situated being, formed in very consequential ways by our interactions with our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment is &quot;man&apos;s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity... [This immaturity consists not in a] lack of understanding, but lack of resolution and courage to use [one&apos;s own understanding] without the guidance of another. &quot;Further, laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large portion of men... remain immature for life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To live authentically, one has to &quot;divorce oneself from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that uncharted journey into the rebellious imperatives of the self.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joint Attention is thus intimately bound up with the capacity for communication, which requires not only awareness of the existence of other minds, but mutual awareness of a joint field of reference: the shared world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no self to be known that exists prior to, or at a &quot;deeper level&quot; than, the self that is in the world. This implies that individuality, too, is something that we achieve only in the through our dealings with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need other people as a check on our own self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes human acts from mere events, and from animal doings, is that we are concerned with justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-realization, and the ability to act by oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project of becoming a grown-up demand that one brings one&apos;s conflicts to awareness; to intellectualize them and become articulate about them, rather than let them drive one&apos;s behavior stupidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal autonomy: the hope for a self that is not in conflict with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Attention is rewarded by a knowledge of reality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to think really means learning to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to direct our attention as we will is a basic condition for living well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where strong emotions of sexual love, or of hatred, resentment, or jealousy are concerned, &quot;pure will&quot; can usually achieve little. It is small use telling oneself &quot;stop being in love, stop feeling resentment, be just.&quot; What is needed is a reorientation which will provide an energy of a different kind, from a different source. Notice the metaphors of orientation and of looking... Deliberately falling out of love is not a jump of the will, it is the acquiring of new object of attention and thus of new energies as a result of refocusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New energies come from real objects that one becomes interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjectivism: &quot;What makes something right is how I feel about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must resist being charmed by the work of art, and not give in to your own emotional response to it, because it is possible to be wrong in these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a culture saturated with technologies for appropriating our attention, our interior mental lives are laid bare as a resource to be harvested by others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mastery]]></title><description><![CDATA[mastery - the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. The brain that we possess is the work of six…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/mastery/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/mastery/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;mastery - the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain that we possess is the work of six million years of development, and more than anything else, this evolution of the brain was designed to lead us to mastery, the latent power within us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body could decay but the mind would continue to learn and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment we operate in may be different, but the brain is essentially the same and its power to learn, adapt, and master time is universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only elites or those with an almost superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must see your attempt at attaining mastery as something extremely necessary and positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I DISCOVER YOUR CALLING: THE LIFE&apos;S TASK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You possess a kind of inner force that seeks to guide you toward your Life&apos;s Task - what you are meant to accomplish in the time that you have to live. In childhood, this force was clear to you. It directed you toward activities and subjects that fit your natural inclinations, that sparked a curiosity that was deep and primal. In the intervening years, the force tends to fade in and out as you listen more to parents and peers, to the daily anxieties that wear away at you. This can be the source of your unhappiness - your lack of connection to who you are and what makes you unique. The first move toward mastery is always inward - learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force. Knowing it with clarity, you will find your way to the proper career path and everything else will fall into place. It is never too late to start this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;II SUBMIT TO REALITY: THE IDEAL APPRENTICESHIP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After your formal education, you enter the most critical phase in your life - a second, practical education known as The Apprenticeship. Every time you change careers or acquire new skills, you reenter this phase of life. The dangers are many, if you are not careful, you will succumb to insecurities, become embroiled in emotional issues and conflicts that will dominate your thoughts; you will develop fears and learning disabilities that you will carry with you throughout your life. Before it is too late you must learn the lessons and follow the path established by the greatest Masters, past and present - a kind of Ideal Apprenticeship that transcends all fields. In the process, you will master the necessary skills, discipline your mind, and transform yourself into an independent thinker, prepared for the creative challenges on the way to mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle is simple and must be engraved deeply in your mind: the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character - the first transformation of your mind and character - the first transformation on the way to mastery. This has a simple consequence: you must choose places of work and positions that offer the greatest possibilities for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;III ABSORB THE MASTER&apos;S POWER: THE MENTOR DYNAMIC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. Instead, you must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-protege relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. The right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience become yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to-person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit. Choose the mentor who best fits your needs and connects your Life&apos;s Task. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IV SEE PEOPLE AS THEY ARE: SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of mastery comes from the emotional drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulations of the people around us. If we are not careful, our minds become absorbed in endless political intrigues and battles. The principal problem we face in the social arena is our naive tendency to project onto people our emotional needs and desires of the moment. We misread their intentions and react in ways that cause confusion or conflict. Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Navigating smoothly the social environment, we have more time and energy to focus on learning and acquiring skills. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;V AWAKEN THE DIMENSIONAL MIND: THE CREATIVE-ACTIVE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you accumulate more skills and internalize the rules that govern your field, your mind will want to become more active, seeking to use this knowledge in ways that are more suited to your inclinations. What will impede this natural creative dynamic from flourishing is not a lack of talent, but your attitude. Feeling anxious and insecure, you will tend to turn conservative with your knowledge, preferring to fit into the group and sticking to the procedures you have learned. Instead, you must force yourself in the opposite direction. As you emerge from your apprenticeship, you must become increasingly bold. Instead of feeling complacent about what you know, you must expand your knowledge to related fields, giving your mind fuel to make new associations between different ideas. You must experiment and look at problems from all possible angles. As your thinking grows more fluid your mind will become increasingly dimensional, seeing more and more aspects of reality. In the end, you will turn against the very rules you have internalized, shaping and reforming them to suit your spirit. Such originality will bring you to the heights of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VI FUSE THE INTUITIVE WITH THE RATIONAL: MASTERY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us have access to a higher form of intelligence, one that can allow us to see more of the world, to anticipate trends, to respond with speed and accuracy to any circumstance. This intelligence is cultivated by deeply immersing ourselves in a field of study and staying true to our inclinations, no matter how unconventional our approach might seem to others. Through such intense immersion over many years we come to internalize and gain an intuitive feel for the complicated components of our field. When we fuse this intuitive feel with rational processes, we expand our minds to the outer limits of our potential and are able to see into the secret core of life itself. We then come to have powers that approximate the instinctive force and speed of animals, but with the added reach that our human consciousness brings us. This power is what our brains were designed to attain, and we will be naturally led to this type of intelligence if we follow our inclinations to their ultimate ends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software]]></title><description><![CDATA[This book does a great job on describing how binary can be used to represent information by using only two states!

&lt;p&gt;When we are present, we are passion, confidence, and comfortable enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness: the ability to go through life with crystalline awareness and to fully inhabit our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence is the state of being attuned to and able to comfortably express our true thoughts, feelings, values, and potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we are able to be ourselves, the more we are able to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus less on the impression you&apos;re making on others and more on the impression you&apos;re making on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragile high self-esteem: their seemingly positive view of themselves depends on continuous external validation, a self-view that&apos;s based less in reality than it is on wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure high self-esteem is internal. People who have a solid sense of self-worth reflect that feeling through healthy, effective ways of dealing with challenges and relationships, making them both more resilient and more open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for you to feel truly present, the various elements of the self, emotions, thoughts, physical, and facial expressions, behaviors must be in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are authentically expressing a genuine emotion, our nonverbal displays tend to follow predictable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth reveals itself more clearly through our actions than it does through our words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The body says what words cannot. The body never lies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence is &quot;when all your senses agree on one thing at the same time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We convince by our presence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic view: the authentic self is an experience, a state, not a trait. I think of it as the experience of knowing and feeling that you&apos;re being your most sincere and courageous self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical and psychological adversity shape us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not enough to identify the values, traits, and strengths that represent your authentic best self, you must then affirm and trust the answers. You must believe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-affirmation: reminding ourselves what matters most to us and, by extension, who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before heading into a situation where we may be challenged, we can reduce our anxiety by reaffirming the parts of our authentic best selves we value most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your boldest self emerges through the experience of having full access to your values, traits, and strengths, and knowing that you can autonomously and sincerely express them through your actions and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be present, it&apos;s not enough to know who you are and express it to others, you need to act on it. A person must be attentive, connected, integrated, and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just be yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find your true presence, it is the strength to be there. To be there in a state of balance, because you&apos;re not trying to protect yourself. You just are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The key to presence is relaxation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation is obviously important, but at some point, you must stop preparing content and start preparing mind-set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that when you become present, you allow others to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence with others is first about showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence is the medium through which trust develops and ideas travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence give you the power to help others in their most challenging moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening is crucial to presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imposter syndrome causes us to overthink and second-guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imposter syndrome steals our power and suffocates our presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel like imposters, we don&apos;t attribute our accomplishments to something internal and constant, such as talent or abilities; instead we credit something beyond our control, such as luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impostor experience stops us from reacting in the moment, it keeps us from responding to the world as it truly exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power activates a psychological and behavioral approach system. When we feel powerful, we feel free in control, unthreatened, and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel powerless, we cannot be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social power is characterized by the ability to exert dominance, to influence or control the behavior of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal power is characterized by freedom from the dominance of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Personal power is all about having the confidence to act based on one&apos;s own beliefs, attitudes, and values, and having the sense that one&apos;s actions will be effective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we feel powerful or powerless has huge consequences in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight effect: to feel that people are paying more attention to us then they actually are... and usually in a bad way, not a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more anxious and self-focused we are during an interaction, the more time we spend past-event processing, ruminating about the interaction, even days later. The thing we&apos;re ruminating about isn&apos;t even real, it&apos;s a seriously flawed memory of an interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is a buffer against negative emotions, it seems to thicken our skin against judgement, rejection, stress, and even physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling powerful can sometimes improve our ability to read and relate to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who feel powerful are also more likely to forgive others, especially those they feel committed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power makes us fearless, independent, and less susceptible to outside pressures and expectations, allowing us to be more creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel powerful, we&apos;re less self-conscious about expressing our feelings and beliefs, and that frees us to think and do great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling powerful synchronizes our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, bringing us closes to presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling powerful gives us the freedom to decide, to act, to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people process a strong belief that they will be able to perform the task at hand, they are more likely to perform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having real-world power seem to protect us from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more personally powerful we feel, the likelier it is that we&apos;ll want to help others feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal power brings us closer to our best selves, while the lack of it distorts and obscures ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path to personal power is also the path to presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power causes us to see ourselves as taller than we actually are and others as smaller than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel powerful, we speak more slowly and take more time. We don&apos;t rush. We&apos;re not afraid to pause. We feel entitled to the time we&apos;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are feeling powerless, in virtually every way that we can, we make ourselves smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s clear that thoughts and feelings shape body language and that each person&apos;s body language speaks to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our body language is also speaking to us, to our own inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions create confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t sing because I&apos;m happy; I&apos;m happy because I sing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary ways we decode other&apos;s emotions is by automatically mimicking their facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be kind to your crow&apos;s feet, and they will be kind to you, and they will make it easier for you to be kind to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings are the consequences... of emotional behavior and bodily response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies don&apos;t just carry us where we want to go: they can help carry us to who we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where our bodies lead, our mind and motions will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that you can control your breathing is a first step to understanding how you can control your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your facial expressions, your postures, your breathing, all clearly affect the way you think, feel, and behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you carry yourself is a source of personal power, the kind of power that is key to presence. It&apos;s the key that allows you to unlock yourself, your abilities, your creativity, your courage, and even your generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding your body expands your mind, which allows you to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-status person is looking at the world and the low-status person is looking at himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in an unhurried way allow us time to communicate clearly, without runaway social anxieties inhibiting us from presenting our true selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding your body language, through posture, movement, and speech, makes you feel more confident and powerful, less anxious and self-absorbed, and generally more positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding your body causes you to think about yourself in a positive light and to trust in that self-concept. It also clears your head, making space for creativity, cognitive persistence, and abstract thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding your body frees you to approach, act, and persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding body language increases our feelings of physical strength and skill; contractive body language decreases them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding your body physiologically prepares you to be present; it overrides your instinct to fight or flee, allowing you to be grounded, open, and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding our body toughens you to physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Power should not be concentrated in the hands of so few and powerlessness in the hands of so many.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as it is to adopt bold power poses before challenging situations, it&apos;s just as important to maintain less bold but still strong, upright, and open postures during challenging situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to avoid falling into the powerless poses we often mindlessly inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about approaching your biggest challenges without dread, executing them without anxiety, and leaving them without regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each challenging situation, we nudge ourselves: we encourage ourselves to feel a little more courageous, to act a bit more boldly, to step outside the walls of our own fear, anxiety, and powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth mind-set: a belief that they can improve in a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our body language is confident and open, other people respond in kind, unconsciously reinforcing not only their perception of us but also our perception of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you reframe your anxiety as excitement, the happier and more successful you may become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to like and respect ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we wear can change how we see, feel, think, and behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each self-nudge, pleasure builds upon pleasure, power upon power, and presence upon presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal effect of presence: you execute with comfortable confidence and synchrony, and you leave with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, regardless of the measurable outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake it till you become it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t fake it till you make it, fake it till you become it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dance your way to presence. Seize the large, beautiful, powerful parts of yourself, the ones you love and believe. They are, indeed, yours for the taking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creativity, Inc. - Overcoming The Unseen Forces That Stand In The Way Of True Inspiration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Gradually, a pattern began to emerge: Someone had a creative idea, obtained funding, brought on a lot of smart people, and developed and…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/creativity-inc/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/creativity-inc/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gradually, a pattern began to emerge: Someone had a creative idea, obtained funding, brought on a lot of smart people, and developed and sold a product that got a boatload of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best managers acknowledge and make room for what they do not know, not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur. They must accept risk; they must trust the people they work with and strive to clear the path for them; and always, they must pay attention to and engage with anything that creates fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhindered communication was key, no matter what your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That to create a fertile laboratory, they had to assemble different kinds of thinkers and then encourage their autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with a challenge, get smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always take a chance on better, even if it seems threatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must believe in the future and your ability to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the care, you put into artistry, visual polish frequently doesn&apos;t matter if you are getting the story right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of talking about whether it&apos;s easier to lower a price than raise it, we should have been addressing more substantive issues such as how to meet the expectations of customers and how to keep investing in software development so that the customers who did buy our product could put it to better use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;just-in-time manufacturing&quot; or &quot;total quality control&quot;: The responsibility for finding and fixing problems should be assigned to every employee, from the most senior manager to the lowliest person on the production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good stuff was hiding the bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Story is King&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust the people. not the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are inevitably difficulties and misstep in any complex creative endeavor, you can trust that &quot;the process&quot; will carry you through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find, develop, and support good people, and they in turn will find, develop, and own good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quality is the best business plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put smart, passionate people in a room together, charge them with identifying and solving problems, and encourage them to be candid with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity has to start somewhere, and we are true believers in the power of bracing, candid feedback and the iterative process, reworking, reworking, and reworking again, until a flawed story finds its through line or a hollow character finds its soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can and should make your own solution group. There are the qualifications required: The people you choose must a) make you think smarter and b) put lots of solutions on the table in a short amount of time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better, more subtle interpretation is that failure is a manifestation of learning and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we as leaders can talk about our mistakes and our part in them, then we make it safe for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open about problems is the first step toward learning from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don&apos;t want too many failures, we must think of the cost of failure as an investment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When experimentation is seen as necessary and productive, not as a frustrating waste of time, people will enjoy their work, even when it is confounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more time you spend mapping out an approach, the more likely you are to get attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a truly creative company, you must start things that might fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial responsibilities of leadership is creating a culture that rewards those who lift not just our stock prices but our aspirations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must demonstrate their trustworthiness, over time, through their actions, and the best way to do that is by responding well to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be patient. Be authentic. And be consistent. The trust will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no growth or success without change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear of change, innate, stubborn, and resistant to reason, is a powerful force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can store patterns and conclusions in our heads, but we cannot store randomness itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creativity, the unknown is not our enemy. If we make room for it instead of shunning it, the unknown can bring inspiration and originality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we allow more people to solve problems without permission, and if we tolerate and don&apos;t vilify their mistakes, then we enable a much larger set of problems to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone says they want to hire excellent people, but in truth we don&apos;t really know, at first, who will rise up to make a difference. I believe in putting in place a framework for finding potential, then nurturing talent and excellence, believing that many will rise, while knowing that not all will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t try and uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that people bring their bets selves to interaction with their bosses and save their lesser moments for their peers, spouses, or therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what turns a successful hierarchy into one that impedes progress: when too many people begin, subconsciously, to equate their own value and that of others with where they fall in the pecking order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hindsight is 20-20&quot;: Accepting that we can look back on what happened, see it with total clarity, learn from it, and draw the right conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past should be our teacher, not our master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&apos;t aware that the majority of what we think we see is actually our brain filling in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor the viewpoints of others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mental models aren&apos;t reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hidden and our acknowledgement of it is an absolutely essential part of rooting out what impedes our progress: clinging to what works, fearing change, and deluding ourselves about our roles in our own success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candor, safety, research, self-assessment, and protecting the new are all mechanisms we can use to confront the unknown and to keep the chaos and fear to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are several mechanisms used to put the collective heads into a different frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dailies, or Solving Problems Together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Power of Limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating Technology and Art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to See&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postmortems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to Learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture of candor and freedom and the kind of constructive self-criticism that allowed our people, and the movies they made, to evolve into their best selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will always have problems, many of which are hidden from our view; we must work to uncover them and assess our own role in them, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; when we then come across a problem, we must marshal all our energies to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unleashing creativity requires that we loosen the controls, accept risk, trust our colleagues, work to clear the path for them, and pay attention to anything that creates fear.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Untethered Soul - The Journey Beyond Yourself]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Voice Inside Your Head The best way to free yourself from this incessant chatter is to step back and view it objectively.

&lt;p&gt;The best way to free yourself from this incessant chatter is to step back and view it objectively. Just view the voice as a vocalizing mechanism that is capable of making it appear like someone is in there talking to you. There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind, you are the one who hears it. The truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it. Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It&apos;s the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems. When you&apos;re just thinking, you&apos;re free to create whatever thoughts you want in your mind. This inner world is an alternate environment that is under your control. This mental manipulation of the outer experience allows you to buffer reality as it comes in. Your consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself. True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection. Come to know the one who watches the voice, and you will come to know one of the great mysteries of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Your Inner Roommate&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, you&apos;ll never be free of problems until you are free from the part within that has so many problems. If you want to achieve peace in the face of your problems, you must understand why you perceive a particular situation as a problem. When a problem is disturbing you, ask, &quot;What part of me is being disturbed by this?&quot; Once you clearly see the disturbed part, then ask, &quot;Who is it that sees this? Who notices this inner disturbance?&quot; This act of maintaining objective awareness of the inner problem is always better than losing yourself in the outer situation. The only real solution is to take the seat of witness consciousness and completely change your frame of reference. The first problem you have to deal with is your own reaction. This involves a change from &quot;outer solution consciousness&quot; to &quot;inner solution consciousness.&quot; The only permanent solution to your problems is to go inside and let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality. There are two distinct aspects of your inner being. The first is you, the awareness, the witness, the center of your willful intentions; and the other is that which you watch. Once you&apos;ve made the decision to free yourself from the mental melodrama, you are ready for teaching and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Who Are You?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attain inner freedom one must continuously and sincerely ask the question &quot;Who am I?&quot; You&apos;re not the outside world. You&apos;re the one who is inside looking out at that world. The same &quot;me&quot; experiences both the outside world and the inside emotions. Eventually, you will get to a point within yourself where you realize that you, the experiencer, have a certain quality. And that quality is awareness, consciousness, and intuitive sense of existence. &quot;I am the one who sees. From back in here somewhere, I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me.&quot; You are in your center of consciousness, that center is the seat of Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Lucid Self&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are an aware being, you no longer become completely immersed in the events around you. Instead, you remain inwardly aware that you are the one who is experiencing both the events and the corresponding thoughts and emotions. The consciousness has the ability to selectively focus awareness on specific objects. When you are in this lost state, you get so totally absorbed in the objects of thoughts, feelings, and the senses, that you forget the consciousness. The lost soul is the consciousness that has dropped into place where one human&apos;s thoughts, emotions, and sensory perceptions of sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell are all synchronized. Then the consciousness makes the mistake of focusing on that one spot too closely. It no longer knows itself as itself. It knows itself as the objects it is experiencing. In other words, you think you are the sum of your learned experience. When you are a centered being, however, your consciousness is always aware of being conscious. Your awareness of being is independent of the inner and outer objects you happen to be aware of. Once you become conscious of the consciousness itself, you are now aware of who you are. The more you are willing to just let the world be something you&apos;re aware of, the more it will let you be who you are, the awareness, the Self, the Atman, the Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Infinite Energy&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every movement of your body, every emotion you have, and every thought that passes through your mind is an expenditure of energy. This is a source of energy you can draw upon from inside. You have a phenomenal amount of energy inside of you and it doesn&apos;t come from food and it doesn&apos;t come from sleep. The only reason you don&apos;t feel this energy all the time is because you block it. When you close your heart, or close your mind, you hide in the darkness within you. The heart is an energy center, and it can open or close. When energy can&apos;t flow in, there&apos;s darkness. You have a wellspring of beautiful energy inside of you. When you are open, you feel it; when you are closed, you don&apos;t. We are programmed based upon our past impressions such that all kinds of things can cause us to open and close. What you&apos;ll find is that the only thing you really want from life is to feel enthusiasm, joy, and love. If you can feel that all the time, then who cares what happens outside? If you make lists of how the world must be for you to open, you have limited your openness to those conditions. Better to be open no matter what. Do not let anything that happens in life be important enough that you&apos;re willing to close your heart over it. The most important thing in life is your inner. Remember, if you love life, nothing is worth closing over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Secrets of the Spiritual Heart&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your heart is an instrument made of extremely subtle energy that runs your life. You are the experiencer of your heart. The heart is an energy center, an area within your being through which your energy focuses, distributes, and flows. The heart closes because it becomes blocked by stored, unfinished energy patterns from your past. As events take place in this world, they come in through your senses and have an impact on your inner state of being. But if the energy pattern that are coming into your psyche create disturbance, you will resist them and not allow them to pass through you. When you do this, the energy patterns actually get blocked within you. What it means to live life is to experience the moment that is passing through you, and then experience the next moment, and then the next. If you could live in this state, you would be a fully aware being. Long term, the energy patterns that cannot make it through you are pushed out of the forefront of the mind and held until you are prepared to release them. When you are unable to allow life&apos;s events to pass through you, they stay inside and become a problem. The point is that past impressions do get stimulated, even old ones, and they affect your life. What is happening is that unfinished mental and emotional energy patterns are getting stored and reactivated. The only impressions that get blocked are those that cause either problems or some extraordinary sense of enjoyment. The alternative is to enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away. Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being. If old energies come back up because you were unable to process them before, let go of them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Transcending the Tendency of Close&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our major struggles end up being with our inner fears, insecurities, and destructive behaviors patterns. When you close down and protect yourself, you are pulling a shell around the part of you that is weak. You are protecting your ego, your self-concept. You feel the need to protect yourself when you&apos;ve experience disturbance, fear, insecurity, and danger. You will get to a point in your growth where you understand that if you protect yourself, you will never be free. The reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem on your mind. A thought or emotion emerges, you notice it, and it passes by because you allow it to. A wise person remains centered enough to let go every time the energy shifts into a defensive mode. No matter what events take place in life, it always better to let go rather than to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Let Go Now or Fall&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&apos;t understand that fear is a thing. It&apos;s just another object in the universe that you are capable of experiencing. You can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from it. Your definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay. Life is not under your control, it&apos;s continuously changing, and if you&apos;re trying to control it, you&apos;ll never be able to fully live it. If you had no fear, you could be perfectly happy living in this world. You&apos;d be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn&apos;t have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance. You only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit that purification process to take place. No matter what it is, let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Removing Your Inner Thorn&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to grow, you must give up the struggle to remain the same, and learn to embrace change at all times. Real transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. If you don&apos;t solve the root cause of the problem, but instead, attempt to protect yourself from the problem, it ends up running your life. Ultimately, if there is something disturbing inside of you, you have to make a choice. You can compensate for the disturbance by going outside in an attempt to avoid feeling it, or you can simply remove the thorn and not focus your life around it. The more you sit in the Self, the more you will begin to feel an energy that you have never experienced before. It comes up from behind, rather than in front where you experience your mind and emotion. Awareness does not fight; awareness releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Stealing Freedom for Your Soul&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prerequisite to true freedom is to decide that you do not want to suffer anymore. You must decide that you want to enjoy your life and that there is no reason for stress, inner pain, or fear. Your inner sensitivities expose you to a minute to minute, constant situation in which you are suffering to one degree or another. You are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. To end suffering, you must first realize that your psyche is not okay. The act of constantly worrying about yourself is a form of suffering. Success means you never have to think about your psyche again. You should never have to figure out how to be okay, or how not to be scared, or how to feel loved. You could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what&apos;s wrong inside of you. The truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. The mind runs because you are giving it the power of your attention. Withdraw your attention, and the thinking mind falls away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pain, the Price of Freedom&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the essential requirements for true spiritual growth and deep personal transformation is coming to peace with pain. Once you can face your disturbances, you will realize that there is a layer of pain seated deep in the core of your heart. This pain is so uncomfortable, so challenging, and so destructive to the individual self, that your entire life is spent avoiding it. Your entire personality is built upon ways of being, thinking, acting, and believing that were developed to avoid this pain. Real growth, takes place when you finally decide to deal with the pain. Inner pain is always there, underneath, hidden by the layers of our thoughts and emotions. We feel it most when our hearts go into turmoil, like when the world does not meet our expectations, this is psychological pain. The choice is to decide that you don’t want to spend your entire life avoiding the inner pain; you&apos;d rather get rid of it. To live with freedom, you must learn to not to be afraid of inner pain and disturbance. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind. If life does something that causes a disturbance inside of you, instead of pulling away, let it pass through you like the wind. In truth, pain is the price of freedom. And the moment you are willing to pay that price, you will no longer be afraid. The moment you are not afraid of the pain, you&apos;ll be able to face all of life&apos;s situations without fear. Spiritual growth exists in the moment when you are consciously willing to pay the price of freedom. You must be willing at all times, in all circumstance, to remain conscious in the face of pain and to work with your heart by relaxing and remaining open. When you are comfortable with pain passing through you, you will be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Taking Down the Walls&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are inside a house, totally sealed off from natural light, and the house is sitting in the middle of an open field full of brilliant light. Your house is made of your thoughts and emotions. The walls are made of your psyche. That&apos;s what the house is. It is all your past experiences; all your thoughts and emotions; all the concepts, views, opinions, beliefs, hopes, and dreams that you have collected around yourself. This mental structure completely blocks you from whatever natural light is on the outside of its walls. When you approach the barrier areas of your thoughts and emotions, it feels like going into an abyss. It is often said that you must go through the darkest night in order to get to the infinite light. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls. There is just your awareness of being and the limited house you built to live in. What you are defending is the house you built to protect yourself. You are hiding inside. You can get out simply by letting everyday life take down the walls you hold around yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Far Far Beyond&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your views, your opinions, your preferences, your concepts, your goals, and your beliefs are all ways of bringing the infinite universe down to the finite where you can feel a sense of control. This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn&apos;t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair. If you want to go beyond your model, you have to take a risk of not believing in it. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits. So, there are two ways you can live: you can devote your life to staying in your comfort zone, or you can work on your freedom. The soul is infinite. It is free to expand everywhere. It is free to experience all of life. This can only happen when you are willing to face reality without mental boundaries. When you approach the edge of your cage you feel insecurity, jealousy, fear, or self-consciousness. You pull back, and if you are like most people, you stop trying. Spirituality begins when you decide that you&apos;ll never stop trying. You end up loving your edges because they point your way to freedom. All you have to do is constantly relax and lean into them. Then one day, when you least expect it, you fall through into the infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Letting Go of False Solidity&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you go deeper into yourself, you will naturally come to realize that there is an aspect of your being that is always there and never changes. This is your sense of awareness, your consciousness. This is the root of Self. You are not your thoughts; you are aware of your thoughts. You are not your emotions; you feel your emotions. You are not your body; you look at it in the mirror and experience this world through its eyes and ears. You are the conscious being who is aware that you are aware of all these inner and outer things. You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. If you dare to look, you will see that you live your entire life based on the model you built around yourself. You just have to take the risk of letting it all go and daring to face the fear that was driving you. You are the one who is in there doing all this, seeing all this, and experiencing all this. You do not have to cling to your experiences in the name of building yourself. When you become truly spiritual, you are totally different from everyone else. You must learn to be comfortable with psychological disturbance. When you&apos;ve let go of the dark psyche, and you&apos;ve let go of the light psyche, and you&apos;re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you. You now become aware of a universe behind your seat of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Path of Unconditional Happiness&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to realize that you really only have one choice in this life. Do you want to be happy, or do you not want to be happy? Once you make that choice, your path through life becomes totally clear. Any condition you create will limit your happiness. Unconditional happiness means you choose to be happy regardless of what happens. The purpose of your life is to enjoy and learn from your experiences. Events don&apos;t determine whether or not you&apos;re going to be happy. You determine whether or not you&apos;re going to be happy. If you learn to stay open at all times, great things will happen to you. The key is to learn to keep your mind disciplined enough so that it doesn&apos;t trick you into thinking that this time it&apos;s worth closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Spiritual Path of Non-Resistance&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should view their spiritual work as learning to live life without stress, problems, fear, or melodrama. If you&apos;re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. If you choose to live this way, you will see that life can be lived in a state of peace. It is not life&apos;s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life&apos;s events that are causing this experience. It is actually possible to never have another problem for the rest of your life. This is because events are not problems; they&apos;re just events. Your resistance to them is what cause the problem. You just deal with them as events that are taking place on the planet Earth, and not as personal problems. Letting go of yourself is the simplest way to get closer to others. The key is to just relax and release, and deal only with what&apos;s left in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Contemplating Death&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly a great cosmic paradox that one of the best teachers in all of life turns out to be death. No person or situation could ever teach you as much as death has to teach you. A wise being completely and totally embraces the reality, the inevitability, and the unpredictability of death. It shouldn&apos;t take death to challenge you to live at your highest level. A wise person affirms, &quot;If with one breath all of this can change, then I want to live at the highest level while I&apos;m alive. I&apos;m going to stop bothering the people I love. I&apos;m going to live life from the deepest part of my being.&quot; You have to be willing to look at what it would be like if death was staring you in the face. Then you have to come to peace within yourself so that it doesn&apos;t make any difference whether it is or not. Let this knowledge help you to live every moment of your life fully, because every moment matters. The beauty of embracing deep truths is that you don&apos;t have to change your life; you just change how you live your life. So, start using every day to let go of that scared part of you that won&apos;t let you live life fully. Learn to live as though you are facing death at all times, and you&apos;ll become bolder and more open. There is no reason to be afraid of life. And the fear will fade once you understand that the only thing there is to get from life is the growth that comes from experiencing it. The highest way to learn is to take each moment of your life and realize that what matters is to live it fully. Death is giving meaning to your life. The wise realize that in the end, life belongs to death. This is how to live your life. You live it as though you were on the verge of death, because you are.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The War Of Art - Break Through The Blocks And Win Your Inner Creative Battles]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's not the writing part that's hard.

What&apos;s hard is sitting down to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two lives, the life we live, and the unlived life. What stands between them is Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Book One: RESISTANCE - Defining the Enemy&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS INVISIBLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS INTERNAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS INSIDIOUS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS IMPLACABLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS IMPERSONAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS INFALLIBLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS UNIVERSAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE NEVER SLEEPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE PLAYS FOR KEEPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS FUELED BY FEAR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE ONLY OPPOSES IN ONE DIRECTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE IS MOST POWERFUL AT THE FINISH LINE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESISTANCE CAN BE BEATEN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it&apos;s the easiest to rationalize. The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become a habit. Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that draws attention to ourselves through pain-free or artificial means is a manifestation of Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruelty to others is a form of Resistance, as is the willing endurance of cruelty from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression and anxiety may be real. But they can also be Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself criticizing other people, you&apos;re probably doing it out of Resistance. Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more scared we are of a work or calling, the surer we can be that we have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you&apos;re feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there&apos;s tremendous love there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work. The professional concentrates on the work and allow rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Book Two: COMBATING RESISTANCE - Turning Pro&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amateur plays for fun. The professional plays for keeps. The amateur plays part-time, the professional full-time. The amateur is a weekend warrior. The professional is there seven days a week. The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it. That&apos;s what I mean when I say turning pro. Resistance hates it when we turn pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Principle of Priority&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and b) you must do what&apos;s important first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are pros in one area: our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What qualities defines us a professional?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show up every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show up no matter what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We stay on the job all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are committed over the long haul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stakes for us are high and real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We accept remuneration for our labor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not overidentify with our jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We master the technique of our jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a sense of humor about our jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive praise or blame in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation, even if it&apos;s for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars’ time to align in his career, but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional eliminates chaos from his world in order to banish it from his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional shuts up, doesn&apos;t talk about it, and does the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional knows that fear can never be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional respects Resistance. He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he&apos;ll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional prepares mentally to absorb blows and to deliver them. His goals are not victory success will come by itself when it wants to but to handle himself, his insides, as sturdily and steadily as he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professional does not show off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional respects his craft, he dedicates himself to mastering technique not because he believes technique is a substitute for inspiration but because he wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional identifies with her consciousness and her will, not with the matter that her consciousness and will manipulate to serve her art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional cannot take rejection personally because to do so reinforces Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional self-validates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the professional cannot let himself take humiliation personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional endures adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional cannot allow the actions of other to define his reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional blows critics off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional learns to recognize envy-driven criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme compliment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional sense who has served his time and who hasn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of professionalism is the focus upon the work and its demands, while we are doing it, to the exclusion of all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s no mystery to turning pro. It&apos;s a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Book Three: Beyond Resistance: The Higher Real&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eternity is in love with the creations of time&quot; means, these creatures of higher sphere or the sphere itself, in the abstract take joy in what we time-bound beings can bring forth into physical existence in our limited material sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I sit down to work, I&apos;ll take a minute and show respects to this unseen Power who can make or break me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;re supposed to learn that things that you think are nothing, as weightless as air, are actually powerful substantial forces, as real and as solid as earth. The eagle was telling me that dreams, visions, meditations such as this very one, things that I had till now disdained as fantasy and illusion, were as real and as solid as anything in my waking life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Self, is a greater entity, which includes the Ego, but also incorporates the Personal and Collective Unconscious. Dreams and intuitions come from the Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Self wishes to create, to evolve. The Ego likes things the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ego produces Resistance and attacks the awakening artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance feeds on fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re not born with unlimited choices. We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the artist to define himself hierarchically is fatal. The artist cannot look to others to validate his efforts or his calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of creation is by definition territorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our orientation is territorial. Here is a test. Of any activity, you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it? It&apos;s about the substances we get comes from the act itself, not from the impression it makes on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or attention or applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It&apos;s a gift to the world and every being in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Obstactle Is The Way - The Timeless Art Of Turning Trials Into Triumph]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our actions may be impeded... but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions.

Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impediment to action advances action.
What stands in the way becomes the way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s simple: a method and framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting upon the obstacles life throws at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;real philosophers&quot;: They had the ability to see obstacles for what they were, the ingenuity to tackle them, and the will to endure a world mostly beyond their comprehension and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our conditions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a goal, obstacles are actually teaching you how to get where you want to go, carving you a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective judgement, now at this very moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unselfish action, now at this very moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willing acceptance, now at this very moment of all external events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps. It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty. &lt;strong&gt;Perception&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, see clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, act correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, endure and accept the world as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see things for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do what we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endure and bear what we must&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What blocked the path now is a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What once impeded action advances action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obstacle is the Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s how we see and understand what occurs around us and what we decide those events will mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will come across obstacles in life fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. You will learn that this reaction determines how successful we will be in overcoming or possibly thriving because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must realize: Nothing makes us feel this way; we choose to give in to such feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see opportunity in every disaster, and transform that negative situation into an education, a skill set, or a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Few things to keep in mind when faced with an obstacle:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To control emotions and keep an even keel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To choose to see the good in a situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To steady our nerves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ignore what disturbs or limits other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To place things in perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To revert to the present moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To focus on what can be controlled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perceptions are the thing that we&apos;re in complete control of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have our wits fully about us, we can step back and remember that situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad. This is something a judgment that we, as human beings, bring to them with our perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstacle make us emotional, but the only way we&apos;ll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defeat emotions with logic, in other words, questions and statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Perspective has two definitions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context: a sense of the larger picture of the world, not just what is immediately in front of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Framing: an individual&apos;s unique way of looking at the world, a way that interprets its events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the right and the wrong perspective is everything. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What is up to us?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our judgement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our creativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an obstacle as a challenge, to make the best of it anyway, that is also a choice, a choice that is up to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this moment is not your life, it&apos;s just a moment in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you&apos;re looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is good in everything, if only we look for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s our preconceptions that are the problem. They tell us that things should or need to be a certain way, so when they&apos;re not, we naturally assume that we are at the disadvantage or that we&apos;d be wasting our time to pursue an alternate course. When really, it&apos;s all fair game, and every situation is an opportunity for us to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything can be flipped, seen with this kind of gaze: a piercing look that ignores the package and see only the gift. This must be a complete flip. Seeing through the negative, past its underside, and into its corollary: the positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see the world as it is, for what it is, you must act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ACTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our movements and decisions define us: We must be sure to act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence. Those are the attributes of right and effective action. Action is the solution and the cure to our predicaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget: In life, it doesn&apos;t matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you&apos;ve been given. And the only way you&apos;ll do something spectacular is by using it all to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;We can always and only greet our obstacles:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a coherent and deliberate process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with iteration and resilience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with pragmatism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with strategic vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with craftiness and savvy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is: Take the bat off your shoulder and give it a swing. You&apos;ve got to start, to go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part: Stay moving, always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know from history that those who attack problems and life with the most initiative and energy usually win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because the conditions aren&apos;t exactly to your liking, or you don&apos;t feel ready yet, doesn&apos;t mean you get a pass. If you want momentum, you&apos;ll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Consider this mind-set:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never in a hurry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never worried&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never desperate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never stopping short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;persist and resist.&quot; Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure really can be an asset if what you&apos;re trying to do is improve, learn, or do something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action and failure are two sides of the same coin. One doesn&apos;t come without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure shows us the way by showing us what isn&apos;t the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the process and not the prize. The process is about finishing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is about doing the right things, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, on the road to where we are going or where we want to be, we have to do things that we&apos;d rather not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we do matters. Everything is a chance to do and be your best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever we are, whatever we&apos;re doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our act, to the world to do it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposites work. Nonaction can be action. So instead of fighting obstacles, find a means of making them defeat themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in your life you need to have patience, wait for temporary obstacles to fizzle out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrongly assume that moving forward is the only way to progress, the only way we can win. Sometimes, staying put, going sideways, or moving backward is actually the best way to eliminate what blocks or impedes your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adversity can harden you. Or it can loosen you up and make you better, if you let it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s at the seemingly bad moments, when people least expect it, that we can act swiftly and unexpectedly to pull off a big victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people shy away from negative situation, just as they do with failure. They do their best to avoid trouble. What great people do is the opposite. They are their best in these situations. They turn personal tragedy or misfortune, really anything, everything to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we accept this as an exclusively negative event, or can we get past whatever negativity or adversity it represents and mount an offensive? Or more precisely, can we see that this &quot;problem&quot; presents an opportunity for a solution that we have long been waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing can ever prevent us from trying. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every situation, that which blocks our path actually presents a new path with a new part of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have it within us to be the type of people who try to get things done, try with everything we&apos;ve got and, whatever verdict comes in, are ready to accept it instantly and move on to whatever it next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WILL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed in some situation that seems unchangeable and undeniably negative, we can turn it into a learning experience, a humbling experience, a chance to provide comfort to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must prepare for adversity and turmoil, we must learn the art of acquiescence and practice cheerfulness even in dark times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility; the other kind of will is weakness disguised by bluster and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Perception and Action were the disciplines of the mind and the body, then Will is the discipline of the heart and the soul. The will is the one thing we control completely, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will is fortitude and wisdom: the strength to endure, contextualize, and derive meaning from the obstacle we cannot simply overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain things in life will cut you open like a knife. When that happens, at that exposing moment, the world gets a glimpse of what&apos;s truly inside you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think, act, and finally adjust to a world that is inherently unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confident, calm, ready to work regardless of the conditions. Willing and able to continue, even during the unthinkable, even when our worst nightmares have come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In every situation, we can:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always prepare ourselves for more difficult times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always accept what we&apos;re unable to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always manage our expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always persevere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always lean to love our fate and what happens to us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always protect our inner self, retreat into ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always submit to a greater, larger cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always remind ourselves of our own mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, prepare to start the cycle once more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We craft our spiritual strength through physical exercise, and our physical hardiness through mental practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do great things, we need to be able to endure tragedy and setbacks. We&apos;ve got to love what we do and all that it entails, good and bad. we have to learn to find joy in every single thing that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept what happens to us, after understanding that certain things, particularly bad things, are outside our control, is this: loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop making it harder on yourself by thinking about I, I, I. Stop putting that dangerous &quot;I&quot; in front of events. I did this. I was so smart, I had that. I deserve better than this. No wonder you take losses personally, no wonder you feel so alone. You&apos;ve inflated your own role and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you&apos;re going through, whatever is holding you down or standing in your way, can be turned into a source of strength, by thinking of people other than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death doesn&apos;t make life pointless, but rather purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about and being aware of our mortality creates real perspective and urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminding ourselves each day that we will die helps us treat our time as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that life is a marathon and not a sprint is important.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flow]]></title><description><![CDATA[HAPPINESS REVISITED Present general principles to transform boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment.

&lt;p&gt;Present general principles to transform boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is not something that happens. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives. We cannot reach happiness by consciously searching for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimal experience: experience we feel when we are in control of our actions, master of our own fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best moments usually occur when a person&apos;s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flow: the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great, cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment by moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person does take the time out to reflect, the disillusionment returns: after each success, it becomes clearer that money, power, status, and possessions do not by themselves, necessarily add one iota to the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple truth, that the control of consciousness determines the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE ANATOMY OF CONSCIOUSNESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events that constitutes consciousness, the &quot;things&quot; we see, feel, think, and desire, are information that we can manipulate and use. Thus, we might think of consciousness as intentionally ordered information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reflection consciousness provides in what we call our life: the sum of all we have heard, seen felt, hoped, and suffered from birth to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information we allow into consciousness becomes extremely important; it is, in fact, what determines the content and the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes attention to retrieve the appropriate reference from memory, to evaluate the event, and then to choose the right thing to do. The work of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to flow attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create ourselves by how we invest in our consciousness. Memories, thoughts, and feeling are all shaped by how we use it. And it is an energy under our control, to do with as we please; hence, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self is no ordinary piece of information, it contains everything else that has passed through consciousness: all the memories, actions, desires, pleasures, and pains are included in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychic disorder: information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names; pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside event appears in consciousness purely as information, without necessarily having a positive or negative value attached to it. It is the self that interprets that raw information in the context of its own interests, and determines whether it is harmful or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, towards separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ENJOYMENT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the quality of life does not directly on what others think of us or on what we own. The bottom line is, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us. To improve life one must improve the quality of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person&apos;s capacity to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimal experience: people become so involved in what they are doing that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, they will not enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow experience is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strength and complexity of the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task is to learn how to enjoy everyday life without diminishing other people&apos;s chances to enjoy theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE CONDITIONS OF FLOW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow activity provides a sense of discovery, a creation feeling of transporting the person into a new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A condition that affects whether an optimal experience will occur or not: an individual&apos;s ability to restructure consciousness so as to make flow possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When adversity threatens to paralyze us, we need to reassert control by finding a new direction in which to invest psychic energy, a direction that lies outside the reach of external forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of strength under extreme adversity is a trait of &quot;unselfconscious individualism,&quot; or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE BODY IN FLOW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoyment does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be enjoyable, a relationship must become more complex. To become more complex, the partners must discover new potentialities in themselves and in each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sexuality, like any other aspect of life, can be made enjoyable if we are willing to take control of it, and cultivate it in the direction of greater complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up the self with its instincts, habits, and desires is so unnatural an act that only someone supremely in control can accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every known culture, the ordering of sound in ways that please the ear has been used extensively to improve the quality of life. Listening to music wards off boredom and anxiety, and when seriously attended to, it can induce flow experience. As with anything else, to enjoy music one must pay attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato believed that children should be taught music before everything else, in learning to pay attention to graceful rhythms and harmonies their whole consciousness would become ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed, and still kept within the bounds of reason. If a person learns to control his instinctual desire, not because he has to, but because he wants to, he can enjoy himself without becoming addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE FLOW OF THOUGHT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow always involves the use of muscle and nerve on the one hand, and will, thought, and feeling on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All forms of mental flow depend on memory, either directly or indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person whose memory is stocked with patterns of information is autonomous and self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is less likely that one will become a bore when one is intrinsically motivated, with a genuine interest in the material, and a desire to control consciousness, rather than in controlling the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person has learned a symbolic system well enough to use it, she has established a portable, self-contained world within the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the capacity to provide its own information, the mind drifts into randomness. It is within each person&apos;s power to decide whether its order will be restored from the outside, in ways over which we have no control, or whether the order will be the result of an internal pattern that grows organically from our skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing gives the mind a disciplined means of expression. It is a way to analyze and understand experience, a self-communication that brings order to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a record of the past can make great contribution to the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialization if for the sake of thinking better, and not an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the end of extrinsically applied education should be the start of an education that is motivated intrinsically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WORD AS FLOW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Work and love.&quot; It is true that if one finds flow in work, and in relations with other people, one is well on the way toward improving the quality of life as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of experience of people who play with and transform the opportunities in their surroundings, is clearly more developed as well as more enjoyable than that of people who resign themselves to live within the constraints of the barren reality they feel they cannot alter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work transforms the worker from an animal guided by instincts into a conscious goal-directed, skillful person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more a job inherently resembles a game, with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges clear goals, and immediate feedback, the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker’s level of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the job people feel skillful and challenged, and therefore feel more happy, strong, creative, and satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who learn to enjoy their work who do not waste their free time, end up feeling that their lives as a whole have become much more worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future will belong not only to the educated man, but to the man who is educated to use his leisure wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ENJOYING SOLITUDE AND ANOTHER PEOPLE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of life depends on two factors: how we experience work, and our relations with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless one learns to tolerate and even enjoy being alone, it is very difficult to accomplish any task that requires undivided concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An illness or other misfortune is less likely to break a person down if he or she can rely on the emotional support of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are the most flexible, the most changeable aspects of the environment we have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore a person who learns to get along with others is to make a tremendous change for the better in quality of life as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude, with no external demands to give structure to attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill free time with activities that require concentration, that increase skills, that lead to a development of the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to use time alone, instead of escaping from it, is especially important in our early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can survive solitude, but only if one finds ways of ordering attention that will prevent entropy from destructuring the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If being alone is seen as a chance to accomplish goals that cannot be reached in the company of others, then instead of feeling lonely, a person will enjoy solitude and might be able to learn new skills in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a person learns to enjoy, much of life will be spent desperately trying to avoid its ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true friend is someone we can occasionally be crazy with, someone who does not expect us to be always true to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reform yourself. That way there will be one less rascal in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who try to make life better for everyone without having learned to control their own lives first usually end up making things worse all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CHEATING CHAOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health, money, and other material advantages may or may not improve life. Unless a person has learned to control psychic energy, chances are such advantages will be useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a person who knows how to find flow from life is able to enjoy even situations that seem to allow only despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to take misfortune and make something good come of it is a very rare gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished, but the good things that belongs to adversity are to be admired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the virtues we can learn no trait is more useful, more essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peak in the development of coping skills is reached when a young man or woman has achieved a strong enough sense of self, based on personally selected goals, that no external disappointment can entirely undermine who he or she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge strong from the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unselfconscious self-assurance: the implicit belief that their destiny was in their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing attention on the world: People who know how to transform stress into enjoyable challenge spend very little time thinking about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of new solution: Two ways to cope with a situation that creates psychic entropy. One is to focus attention on the obstacles to achieving one’s goals and then to move them out of the way, thereby restoring harmony in consciousness. The other is to focus on the entire situation, including oneself, to discover whether alternative goals may not be more appropriate, and thus different solution possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person must formulate new goals, and create a new flow activity for himself, or else he will waste his energies in inner turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one operates with unselfconscious assurance, and remains open to the environment and involved in it, a solution is likely to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;autotelic self&quot; is one that easily translates potential threats into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Rules for developing autotelic self&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming immersed in the activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying attention to what is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to enjoy immediate experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE MAKING OF MEANING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we enjoyed work and friendships, and faced every challenge as an opportunity to develop new skills, we would be getting rewards out of living that are outside the realm of ordinary life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as it provides clear objectives, clear rules for actions, and a way to concentrate and become involved, any goal can serve to give meaning to a person&apos;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have to discover a goal that will give meaning to life on our own, without the help of a traditional faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who find their lives meaningful usually have a goal that is challenging enough to take up all their energies, a goal that can give significance to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is in harmony no matter what he does, no matter what is happening to him, knows that his psychic energy is not being wasted on doubt, regret, guilt, and fear, but is always usefully employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must invest energy in recognizing, understanding, and finding ways to adapt to the forces beyond the boundaries of our own individuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No goal can have much effect unless taken seriously. Each goal prescribes a set of consequences, and if one isn&apos;t prepared to reckon with them, the goal becomes meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if goals are well chosen, and if we have the courage to abide by them despite opposition, we shall be so focused on the actions and events around us that we won&apos;t have the time to be unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge for us is to create harmony based on reason and choice. Life theme is the goal-directed actions that provide shape and meaning to an individual&apos;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People discovered life theme in many cases a reaction to a great personal hurt suffered in early life, to being orphaned, abandoned, or treated unjustly. But what matters is not the trauma per se; the external event never determines what the theme will be. What matters is the interpretation that one places on the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people confronted with the randomness of existence have drawn hope from the knowledge that others before them had faced similar problems, and had been able to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most promising faith for the future might be based on the realization that the entire universe is a system related by common laws and that it makes no sense to impose our dreams and desires on nature without taking them into account.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man's Search For Meaning]]></title><description><![CDATA[He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.

&lt;p&gt;He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, or a quest for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Three possible sources for meaning: in work doing something significant, in love caring for another person, and in courage during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t aim at success, the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one&apos;s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&apos;s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run, in the long run, I say! success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedom, to choose one&apos;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&apos;s own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man, his courage and hope, or lack of them, and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two races of men in this world, but only these two, the &quot;race&quot; of the decent man and the &quot;race&quot; of the indecent man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&apos;s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a &quot;secondary rationalization&quot; of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significant which will satisfy his own will to meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person&apos;s life at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone&apos;s task is as unique as is specific opportunity to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can discover the meaning in life in three different ways; 1) by creating a work or doing a deed; 2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, does not simple exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. Every human has the freedom to change at any instant. Man, is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, has both potentialities within himself: which one is actualized depends on decision but not on conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Habit - Why We Do What We Do In Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Habit: the choices that all of us deliberately make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day.

&lt;p&gt;The process in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is known as &quot;chunking&quot;, and it&apos;s at the root of how habits form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a &lt;strong&gt;cue&lt;/strong&gt;, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit is use. Then there is the &lt;strong&gt;routine&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a &lt;strong&gt;reward&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time this loop becomes more and more automatic and a habit is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are so powerful, they create neurological craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden Rule of habit change, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief is the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. We do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keystone habits say that success doesn&apos;t depend on getting single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. Small wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes. &quot;Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.&quot; The second way that keystone encourage habits change: by creating structures that help other habits to flourish. The final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. Willpower is a learnable skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People want to be in control of their lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational habit offer a basic promise: If you follow the established patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won&apos;t destroy the company, the profits will roll in, and, eventually, everyone will get rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are unique to each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People&apos;s buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dress a new something in old habits, it&apos;s easier for the public to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential, if not more, than our close-tie friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit reigned supreme, the behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function. However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. We know bad habits exist and once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom and responsibility to remake them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change and that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we choose who we want to be, people grow to the way in which they have been exercised, just as sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you believe you can change, if you make it a habit, the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are these two-young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &apos;Morning boys. How&apos;s the water?&apos; And the two-young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &apos;What the hell is water?&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surrounds us every day and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every habit abides by a set of rules, and when you understand those codes you gain influence over them. Any habit can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less]]></title><description><![CDATA[The basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/essentialism/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/essentialism/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less but better&lt;/strong&gt;: The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better in a disciplined way. This involves learning to tell the difference, learning to filter through all those options and selecting only those that are truly essential. It&apos;s not about how to get more things done; it&apos;s about how to get the right things done. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t prioritize your life, someone else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of success can be a catalyst for failure, in other words, success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision fatigue:&lt;/strong&gt; the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decision deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As painful as they can sometime be, trade-offs represent a significant opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential intent applies to so much than your job description or your company&apos;s mission statement; a true essential intent is one that guides your greater senese of purpose, and helps you chart your life&apos;s path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of an Essentialist is a life of meaning. It is a life that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you become an Essentialist, you will find that you aren&apos;t like everybody else. When other people are saying yes, you will find yourself saying no. When other people are doing, you will find yourself thinking. When other people are speaking, you will find yourself listening. When other people are in the spotlight, vying for attention, you will find yourself waiting on the sidelines until it is time to shine. While other people are padding their resumes and building out their LinkedIn profiles, you will be building a career of meaning. While other people are complaining about how busy they are, you will just be smiling sympathetically, unable to relate. While other people are living a life of stress and chaos, you will be living a life of impact and fulfillment. In many ways, to live as an Essentialist in our too many things all the time society is an act of quiet revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Essentialist&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I choose to.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinks almost everything is nonessential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asks, &quot;What is the trade-off I want to make?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asks, &quot;What can I go big on?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates space to escape and explore life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pays attention to the signal in the noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hears what is not being said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scans to find the essence of the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knows play is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knows play sparks exploration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hour more of sleep equals several more hours of much higher productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep is for high performers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep is a priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep breeds creativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep enables the highest level of mental contribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Says yes to only the top 10 percent of opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses narrow, explicit criteria like &quot;Is this exactly what I am looking for?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a strategy that is concrete and inspirational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has an intent that is both meaningful and memorable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes one decision that eliminates one thousand later decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dares to say no firmly, resolutely, and gracefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Says yes only to the things that really matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asks, &quot;If I weren&apos;t already invested in this project, how much would I invest in it now?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinks, &quot;What else could I do with this time or money if I pulled the plug now?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with cutting loses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinks that making things better means subtracting something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates the distracting words, images, and details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knows that if you have limits you will become limitless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sees boundaries as liberating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets rules in advance that eliminate the need for the direct &quot;no&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds in a buffer for unexpected events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practices extreme and early preparation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove obstacles to progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brings forth more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts small and gets big results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrates small acts of progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design a routine that enshrines what is essential, making execution almost effortless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes the essential the default position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind is focused on the present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tunes in to what is important right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoys the moment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The Three Rules of Epidemics&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law of the Few&lt;/strong&gt;: a tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stickiness Factor&lt;/strong&gt; says that there are specific ways of making a contagious message memorable; there are relatively simple changes in the presentation and structuring of information that can make a big difference in how much of an impact it makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Context&lt;/strong&gt; says that human beings are a lot more sensitive to their environment than they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Law of the Few&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word-of-mouth epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectors&lt;/strong&gt; are people with a special gift for bringing the world together. The strength of weak ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maven&lt;/strong&gt; means one who accumulates knowledge and shares it with others, the motivation is to educate and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salesmen&lt;/strong&gt; are a group of people with the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are hearing. Emotion is contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Stickiness Factor&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In epidemics, the massager matter: messengers are what make something spread. But the content of the message matter too. And the specific quality that a message needs to be successful is the quality of &quot;stickiness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhance stickiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching something intellectually and physically, the more memorable and meaningful it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. All you have to do is find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Power of Context&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and places in which they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impetus to engage in a certain kind of behavior is not coming from a certain kind of person but from feature of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, by tinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the Power of Context is that in ways that we don&apos;t necessarily appreciate, our inner states are the results of our outer circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honesty isn&apos;t a fundamental trait or a &quot;unified&quot; trait. A trait like honesty is considerably influenced by the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/strong&gt; FAE: when it comes to interpreting other people&apos;s behavior, human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance of fundamental character traits and underestimating the importance of the situation and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bounded together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Power of Context says that those &lt;em&gt;Tipping Points&lt;/em&gt; may be as simple and trivial as everyday signs of disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power of Context says simply that children are powerfully shaped by their external environment, that the features of our immediate social and physical world, the streets we walk down, the people we encounter, plays a hug role in shaping who we are and how we act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rule of 150&lt;/strong&gt; suggests that the size of a group is another one of those subtle contextual factors that can make a big difference. The advantage of This Rule is to exploit the bonds of memory and peer pressure. When people know each other well, they create an implicit joint memory system, a transactive memory system, which is based on an understanding about who is best suited to remember what kinds of things. The psychological preconditions for transactive memory: it&apos;s knowing someone well enough to know what they know, and knowing them well enough so that you can trust them to know things in their speciality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradox of the epidemic: that in order to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many small movements first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation: What Mavens and Connectors and Salesmen do to an idea in order to make it contagious is to alter it in such a way that extraneous details are dropped and others are exaggerated so that the message itself comes to acquire a deeper meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That our environment plays as big, if not bigger, a role as heredity in shaping personality and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the environmental influence that helps children become who they are, that shapes their character and personality, is their peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That people can radically transform their behavior or beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. We are actually powerfully influenced by our surroundings, our immediate context, and the personalities of those around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peak - Secrets From The New Science Of Expertise]]></title><description><![CDATA[We are all endowed with a brain so flexible and adaptable that it could, with the right sort of training, develop a capability that seems…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/peak/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/peak/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We are all endowed with a brain so flexible and adaptable that it could, with the right sort of training, develop a capability that seems quite magical to those of us who do not possess it. Realize that the brain, even the adult brain, is for more adaptable than anyone ever imagined, and this gives us a tremendous amount of control over what our brains are able to do. Both the brain and body are more adaptable in young children than in adults. Still both the brain and body retain great deal of adaptability throughout adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have the adaptability of the human brain and body. Some people are amazingly good at what they do through dedicated training that drives changes in the brain and sometimes depending on the ability, in the body that make it possible for them to do things that they otherwise could not. The ability to create, through the right sort of training and practice, abilities that they would not otherwise possess by taking advantage of the incredible adaptability of the human brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about a fundamentally new way of thinking about human potential, we have far more power than we ever realized to take control of our own lives. In this new world, it no longer makes sense to think of people as born with fixed reserves of potential; instead, potential is an expandable vessel, shaped by the various things we do throughout our lives. Learning isn&apos;t a way of reaching one&apos;s potential but rather a way of developing it. We can create our own potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice remains the gold standard for anyone in any field who wishes to take advantage of the gift of adaptability in order to build new skills and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Power of Purposeful Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that the most effective and most powerful types of practice in any field work by harnessing the adaptability of the human body and brain to create, step by step, the ability to do things that were previously not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a person reaches that level of &quot;acceptable&quot; performance and automaticity, the additional years of &quot;practice&quot; don&apos;t lead to improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purposeful practice has several characteristics that set it apart from what we might call &quot;naive practice,&quot; which is essentially just doing something repeatedly, and expecting that the repetition alone will improve one&apos;s performance. Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals, is focused, involves feedback, and requires getting out of one&apos;s comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat here is that while it is always possible to keep going and keep improving, it is not always easy. Maintaining the focus and the effort required by purposeful practice is hard work, and it is generally not fun. Meaningful positive feedback is one of the crucial factors in maintaining motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Harnessing Adaptability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know enough to have a clear idea of how purposeful and mental capabilities make it possible to do things that we never could before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human brain grows and changes in response to intense training. The human body is incredibly adaptable, that the brain&apos;s structure and function are not fixed. They change in response to use. It is possible to shape the brain, in the way that we desire through conscious, deliberate training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeostasis refers to the tendency of a system to act in a way that maintains its own stability. The body desire for homeostasis can be harnessed to drive changes: push it hard enough and for long enough, and it will respond by changing in ways that make that push easier to do. You need to continually push to keep the body&apos;s compensatory changes coming, but if you push too far outside your comfort zone, you risk injuring yourself and actually setting yourself back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term training results in changes in those parts of the brain that are relevant to the particular skill being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive and physical changes caused by training requires upkeep. Stop training, and they start to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people live lives that are not particularly physically challenging. The reason that most people don&apos;t possess extraordinary physical capabilities isn&apos;t because they don&apos;t have the capacity for them, but rather because they&apos;re satisfied to live in the comfortable rut of homeostasis and never do the work that is required to get out of it. They live in the world of &quot;good enough.&quot; But it&apos;s important to remember that the option exists. If you wish to become significantly better at something, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deliberate practice the goal is not just to reach your potential but to build it, to make things possible that were not possible before. This requires challenging homeostasis, getting out of your comfort zone, and forcing your brain or your body to adapt. But once you do this, learning is no longer just a way of fulfilling some genetic destiny; it becomes a way of taking control of your destiny and shaping your potential in ways that you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mental Representations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly developed mental processes are seen in expert performers in every field and hold the key to understanding their extraordinary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mental representation is a mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of deliberate practice involves developing ever more efficient mental representations that you can use in whatever activity you are practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key fact about such mental representations is that they are very &quot;domain specific,&quot; they apply only to the skills for which they were developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing that sets experts apart from the rest of us is that their years of practice have changed the neural circuitry in their brains to produce highly specialized mental representations, which in turn make possible the incredible memory, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other sorts of advanced abilities needed to excel in their particular specialties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way in which expert performers use mental representations to improve their performance: they monitor and evaluate their performance, and, when necessary, they modify their mental representation in order to make them more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between skill and mental representations is a virtuous circle: the more skilled you become, the better your mental representation are, and the better your mental representation are, the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Goal Standard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal standard is the ideal to which anyone learning a skill should aspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no agreement on what good performance is and no way to tell what changes would improve performance, then it is very difficult, often impossible, to develop effective training methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody develops extraordinary abilities without putting in tremendous amount of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purposeful practice in which a person tries very hard to push himself or herself to improve. Deliberate practice is purposeful practice that knows where it is going and how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, identify the expert performers, then figure out what they do that makes them so good, then come up with training techniques that allows you to do it, too. Be careful when identifying expert performers. Ideally you want some objective measure of performance with which to compare people&apos;s abilities. Once you&apos;ve identified the expert performers in a field, the next step is to figure out specifically what they do that separates them from other, less accomplished people in the same field, and what training methods helped them get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you are able to tailor your training to mirror the best performers in your field, the more effective your training is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pretty much any area of human endeavor, people have a tremendous capacity to improve their performance, as long as they train in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Principles of Deliberate Practice in the Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step toward enhancing performance is to abandon the following, the belief that one&apos;s abilities are limited by one&apos;s genetically prescribed characteristic, that if you do something for long enough, you&apos;re bound to get better at it, and lastly that all it takes to improve is effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliberate practice mindset is anyone can improve, but it requires the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training with immediate feedback either from a mentor or even a carefully designed computer program, can be an incredibly powerful way to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to present knowledge to a large group of people than it is to set up conditions under which individuals can develop skills through practice. One result is that when college students enter the work world, they often find that they need a lot of time to develop the skills they need to do their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training should focus on doing rather than on knowing and, in particular, on bringing everyone&apos;s skills closer to the level of the best performers in a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Principles of Deliberate Practice in Everyday Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice is for everyone who dreams. It&apos;s for all those people who want to take control of their lives and create their own potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main purpose of deliberate practice is to develop a set of effective mental representations that can guide performance. When you&apos;re practicing by yourself, you have to rely upon your own mental representation to monitor your performance and determine what you might be doing wrong. This is not impossible, but it is much more difficult and less efficient than having an experienced teacher watching you and providing feedback. Thus, one of the most important things you can do for your success is to find a good teacher and work with him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things a teacher can do is to help you develop your own mental representations so that you can monitor and correct your own performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to change teachers as you yourself change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your mind is wandering or you&apos;re relaxed and having fun, you probably won&apos;t improve. Whatever you are doing, focus on it. Learning to engage in consciously developing and refining your skills, is one of the most powerful ways to improve the effectiveness of your practice. It is better to train at 100 percent effort for less time than at 70 percent effort for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet offers just about everything except quality control, but you can get some good ideas and tips, try them out, and see what works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purposeful practice, it does no good to do the same thing over and over again mindlessly; the purpose on getting better in those areas, trying different methods to improve until you find something that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effectively practice a skill without a teacher, it helps to keep in mind three F&apos;s: Focus, Feedback, Fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true for everyone who faces a plateau, the best way to move beyond it is to challenge your brain or your body in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguished the most successful performers was their superior ability to remain committed to studying despite the boredom and the pull of other, more appealing activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you quit something that you had initially wanted to do it&apos;s because the reasons to stop eventually come to outweigh the reason to continue. Thus, to maintain your motivation you can either strengthen the reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stop believing that you can reach a goal, either because you&apos;ve regressed or you&apos;ve plateaued, don&apos;t quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to create and sustain social motivation is to surround yourself with people who will encourage and support and challenge you in your endeavors. Put together a group of people all interested in the same thing or join an existing group and use the group&apos;s camaraderie and shared goals as extra motivation in reaching your own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason not to follow your dream. Deliberate practice can open the door to a world of possibilities that you may have been convinced were out of reach. Open that door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Road to Extraordinary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of expert performers is that even once they become one of the best of what they do, they still constantly strive to improve their practice techniques and to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three stages that are common for experts with extraordinary abilities. First stage, children are introduced in a playful way to what will eventually become their field of interest. Once a future expert performer becomes interested and show some promise in an area, the typical next step is to take lessons from a coach or teacher. Generally when they&apos;re in their early or mid teens, the future experts make a commitment to becoming the best that they can be. This commitment is the third stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in the early days of an expert development, maintaining that interest and motivation while the skills and habits are being built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-selection process: that the only people who would spend years practicing something are whose who naturally love to do it, but it is also possible that the practice itself may lead to physiological adaptations that produce more enjoyment and more motivation to do that particular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fourth stage of expert performance, where some people move beyond the existing knowledge in their field and make unique creative contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity goes hand in hand with the ability to work hard and maintain focus over long stretches of time, exactly the ingredient of deliberate practice that produced their expert abilities in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative, the restless, and the driven are not content with the status quo, and they look for ways to move forward, to do things that others have not. Progress is made by those who are working on the frontiers of what is known and what is possible to do, we must rely on the experts to move us forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But What About Natural Talent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the extraordinary abilities are the product of much practice and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where Do We Go from Here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that expert performers and aspiring expert performers can do to improve their training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice is all about the skills. you pick up the necessary knowledge in order to develop the skills; Knowledge should never be an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you teach a student facts, concepts, and rules, those things go into long-term memory as individual pieces, and if a student then wishes to do something with them, use them to solve a problem, reason with them to answer a question, or organize and analyze them to come up with a theme or a hypothesis, the limitations of attention and short-term memory kick in. The student must keep all of these different unconnected pieces in mind while working with them toward a solution. However, if this information is assimilated as part of building mental representations aimed at doing something, the individual pieces become part of an interconnected pattern that provides context and meaning to the information, making it easier to work with. When you&apos;re done, not only have you developed an effective mental representation for the skill you were developing, but you have also absorbed a great deal of information connected with that skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When teaching a skill, break the lesson into a series of steps that the student can master one at a time, building from one to the next to reach the ultimate objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In almost any area of education the most useful learning objective will be those that help student develop effective mental representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One benefit that a young student or anyone gets from developing mental representations is the freedom to begin exploring that skill on his or her own. Having students create mental representation in one area helps them understand exactly what it takes to be successful not only in that area but in others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are not born with some innate talent, but rather because they have developed their abilities through years of practice, taking advantage of the adaptability of the human body and brain. We need to give people the tools they need to harness that adaptability and take control of their own potential, based on the principles of deliberate practice and aimed at creating more effective mental representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important gifts we can give our children are the confidence in their ability to remake themselves again and again and the tools with which to do that job. They will need to see firsthand, through their own experiences of developing abilities they thought were beyond them, that they control their abilities and are not held hostage by some antiquated idea of natural talent. And they will need to be given the knowledge and support to improve themselves in whatever ways they choose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Dip - A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (And When to Stick)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quit the wrong stuff.

&lt;p&gt;Quit the wrong stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick with the right stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have the guts to do one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners win big because the marketplace loves a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarcity makes being at the top worth something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dip is the secret to your success. The people who set out to make it through the Dip, the people who invest the time and the energy and the effort to power through the Dip, those are the ones who become the best in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&apos;t make it through the Dip, don&apos;t start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a superstar, then you need to find a field with a steep Dip, a barrier between those who try and those who succeed. And you&apos;ve got to get through that Dip to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You run out of time and quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You run out of money and quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get scared and quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&apos;re not serious about it and quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You lost interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre and quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You focus on the short term instead of the long and quit when the short term gets too hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world because you don&apos;t have the talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s the goal of any competitor: to create a Dip so long and so deep that the nascent competition can&apos;t catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re going to quit, quit before you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with the Dip, most people suck it up and try to average their way to success. Instead, use the Dip as an opportunity to create something so extraordinary that people can&apos;t help but talk about it, recommend it, and yes; choose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand this: If you&apos;re not able to get through the Dip in an exceptional way, you must quit. And quit right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do, which is why it&apos;s so important for you to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quitting the projects that don&apos;t go anywhere is essential if you want to stick out the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your job is a Cul-de-Sac French for &quot;dead end&quot;, you have to quit or accept the fact that your career is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic quitting is a conscious decision you make based on the choices that are available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coping is what people do when they try to muddle through. Quitting is better than coping because quitting frees you up to excel at something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quitting as a short-term strategy is a bad idea. Quitting for the long term is an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never quit something with great long term potential just because you can&apos;t deal with the stress of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pride is the only thing keeping you from quitting, if there&apos;s no Dip to get through, you&apos;re likely wasting an enormous amount of time and money defending something that will heal pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Three Questions to Ask Before Quitting&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AM I PANICKING?&lt;/strong&gt; The best quitters, are the ones who decide in advance when they&apos;re going to quit. You can always quit later, so wait until you&apos;re done panicking to decide. The reason so many of us quit in the Dip is that without a compass or a plan, the easiest thing to do is to give up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO AM I TRYING TO INFLUENCE?&lt;/strong&gt; Influencing one person is like scaling a wall. If you get over the wall the first few tries, you&apos;re in. If you don&apos;t, often you&apos;ll find that the wall gets higher with each attempt. Influencing a market, on the other hand, is more of a hill than a wall. You can make progress, one step at a time, and as you get higher, it actually gets easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT SORT OF MEASURABLE PROGRESS AM I MAKING?&lt;/strong&gt; To stick with it in the absence of forward progress, is a waste. It&apos;s a waste because of the opportunity cost, you could be doing something far better, and far more pleasurable, with your time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down under what circumstances you&apos;re will to quit. And when. And then stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve got as much as you&apos;ve got, use it. Use it to become the best in the world. You can only do that by marshaling all of your resources to get through the biggest possible Dip. In order to get through that Dip, you&apos;ll need to quit everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grit - The Power Of Passion And Perserverance]]></title><description><![CDATA[The highly successful had a kind of ferocious determination that played out in two ways.

First, these exemplars were usually resilient and hardworking. Second, they knew in a very, very deep way what it was they wanted. They not only had determination, they had direction. It was this combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers special. In a word, they had grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work; and I still think this is an eminently important difference.&quot; Zeal and hard work are ultimately more important than intellectual ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped our drafts are checked. We are making use only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The human individual lives usually far within his limits; he possesses power of various sorts which he habitually fails to use. He energizes below his maximum, and he behaves below his optimum.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The plain fact remains that men the world over possesses amounts of resource, which only very exceptional individual push to their extremes of use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the most general sense, talent is the sum of a person&apos;s abilities, his or her intrinsic gifts, skills, knowledge, experience, intelligence, judgement, attitude, character, and drive. It also includes his or her ability to learn and grow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can&apos;t easily see how experience and training get someone to a level of excellence that is so clearly beyond the norm, we default to labeling that person a &quot;natural&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great things are accomplished by those &quot;people whose thinking is active in one direction, who employ everything as material, who always zealously observe their own inner life and that of others, who perceive everywhere models and incentives, who never tire of combining together the means available to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The separation of talent and skills is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, who want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you&apos;re willing to stay loyal to it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grit has two components: passion and perseverance. Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion acts like a compass, that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and that then guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any successful person has to decided what to do in part by deciding what not to do. &quot;A clear, well-defined philosophy give you the guidelines and boundaries that keep you on track.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long term passion and perseverance as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My advice for you is, figure out what you enjoy doing most in life, and then try to do it full time. Life is short. Follow your passion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever it is that you want to do, you&apos;ll find in life that if you&apos;re not passionate about what it is you&apos;re working on, you won&apos;t be able to stick with it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion for your work is a little bit of discovery, followed by a lot of development, and then a life time of deepening. Before hard work comes play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest&lt;/strong&gt;: the desire to learn new things, to explore the world, to seek novelty, to be on the lookout for change and variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever our age, over time your role as a learner will become a more active and informed one. Over a period of years, your knowledge and expertise will grow, and along with it your confidence and curiosity to know more. Kaizen, continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is performing at high levels of challenge and yet feeling &quot;effortless&quot;, like you don&apos;t have to think about it, you&apos;re just doing it. Deliberate practice requires working where challenges exceed skill, and flow is most commonly experienced when challenge and skill are in balance. Remember deliberate practice is exceptionally effortful, and flow is, by definition, effortless. Gritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even when the learning is hard, it is not bitter when you feel that is worth having that you can master it, that practicing what you learned will express who you are and help you achieve what your desire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deliberate practice, make it a habit/daily ritual, follow routines. They&apos;re creatures of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: the intention to contribute to the well-being of others. Some of us care about purpose much more than we care about pleasure, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gritter people are dramatically more motivated than others to seek a meaningful, other-centered life. Most gritty people see their ultimate aims as deeply connected to the world beyond themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A calling is not some fully formed thing that you find, it&apos;s much more dynamic. Whatever you do, whether you&apos;re a janitor or the CEO, you can continually look at what you do and ask how it connects to other people, how it connects to the bigger picture, how it can be an expression of your deepest values.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I am around people, my heart and soul radiate with the awareness that I am in the presence of greatness. Maybe greatness unfound, or greatness underdeveloped, but the potential or existence of greatness nevertheless, you never know who will go on to do good or even great things or become the next great influencer in the world, so treat everyone like they are the person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One kind of hope is the expectation that tomorrow will be better than today. Grit depends on a different kind of hope. It rests on the expectation that our own efforts can improve our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you keep searching for ways to change your situation for the better, you stand a chance of finding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;growth mindset, you believe you can learn to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you have setbacks and failures, you can&apos;t overreact to them. You need to step back, analyze them, and learn from them. But you also need to stay optimistic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just keep working hard and learning, and it will all work out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fixed mindset about ability leads to pessimistic explanation of adversity, and that, in turn, leads to both giving up on challenges and avoiding them in the first place. In contrast, a growth mindset leads to optimistic ways of explaining adversity, and that, in turn, leads to perseverance and seeking out new challenges that will ultimately make you even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With practice and guidance, you can change the way you think, feel, and most important, act when the going gets rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve always had an instinctive sense that life and nature and evolution have planted in children their own capabilities, their own destiny. Like a plant, if they&apos;re fed and watered in the right way, they will grow up beautiful and strong. It&apos;s just a question of creating the right environment, a soil that is nurturing, that is listening and responsive to their needs. Children carry within them the seed of their own future. Their own interests will emerge if we trust them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t have to be a parent to make a difference in someone&apos;s life. If you just care about them and get to know what&apos;s going on, you can make an impact. Try to understand what&apos;s going on in their life and help them through that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following through on hard things teaches young person powerful, transferable lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s a hard way to get grit and an easy way. The hard way is to do it by yourself. The easy way is to use conformity, the basic human drive to fit in, because if you&apos;re around a lot of people who are gritty, you&apos;re going to act grittier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Failure are going to happen, and how you deal with them may be the most important thing in whether you succeed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Use mistakes and problems as opportunities to get better, not reasons to quit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our grit, our passion and perseverance for long term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grow your grit. On your own from the &lt;strong&gt;inside out:&lt;/strong&gt; You can develop a habit of daily challenge, exceeding, skill practice. You can connect your work to a purpose beyond yourself. And you can learn to hope when all seem lost. You can also grow your grit from the &lt;strong&gt;outside in:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents, coaches, teachers, bosses, mentors, friends, developing your personal grit depends critically on other people.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Deep Work - Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/deep-work/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/deep-work/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skills, and are hard to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shallow Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Noncognitive demanding, logistical-style task, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep work is a skill that has great value today. There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning, to remain valuable in our economy, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is essentially limitless, which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you&apos;re producing is mediocre, then you&apos;re in trouble, as it&apos;s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online. To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you&apos;re capable of producing, a task that requires depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deep Work Hypothesis:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasing rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasing valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate the skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it&apos;s not a philosophical statement, it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Deep Work Is Valuable&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two groups that are poised to thrive and are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field. The core abilities for thriving in the new economy is the ability to quickly master hard things and the ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed. These two abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work. Remember that a deep life is a good life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn requires intense concentrations and deliberate practice. You must train your attention to focus tightly on a specific skill you&apos;re trying to improve or an idea you&apos;re trying to master. As you are mastering a skill, you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where its most productive. To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;High&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Producted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Spent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Intensity&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention residue:&lt;/strong&gt; Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn&apos;t immediately follow, a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To produce at your peak level, you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Deep Work Is Rare&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Least Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Busyness as Proxy for Productivity:&lt;/strong&gt; In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward, an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Deep Work Is Meaningful&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived. What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore, plays in defining the quality of our life. Our brains construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. &quot;Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love, is the sum of what you focus on.&quot; If you spend enough time in a positive state, your mind will understand your world as a rich in meaning and importance, concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems. I&apos;ll live the focused life, because it&apos;s the best kind there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one&apos;s work, to concentrate and lost oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. Humans beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow state is generated by the notations of stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating and losing yourself in an activity, all of which also describe deep work. To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craftsmanship provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. A source of meaning sited outside the individual. The task of a craftsman, is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meaning that are already there. Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Rule #1 Work Deeply&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work deeply you must turn your attention toward something more superficial. You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to our working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must carefully choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monastic Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bimodal Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; ask that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhythmic Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; the easiest way to consistently start deep work session is to transform them into a simple regular habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalist Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; you fit deep work where ever you can into your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a ritual are that it provides your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Grand Gesture:&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Theory of Serendipitous Creativity:&lt;/strong&gt; when you allow people to bump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pursuing innovation, collaborative deep work can yield better results. The key is to maintain in &lt;strong&gt;hub and spoke style arrangement&lt;/strong&gt;: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter. When it comes to deep work consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Entrenched companies are often unexpectedly dethroned by start-ups that begin with cheap offering at the low end of the market, but then, over time, improve their cheap products just enough to begin to steal high-end market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work:&lt;/strong&gt; the serious efforts that produce things the world values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you&apos;re done, be done. A key commitment for succeeding is your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule #1 taught you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your concentration ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Rule #2 Embrace Boredom&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule #2 will help you significantly improve your concentration ability by training yourself to address these two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation unless you have stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important reality about deep work: The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s common to treat undistracted concentration as a habit, something that we you know how to do and know is good for you, but that you&apos;ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don&apos;t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it&apos;s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet Sabbath:&lt;/strong&gt; this ritual asks you to put aside regular time, typically, one day a week, where you refrain from network technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the Internet Sabbath, instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it&apos;s incredibly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with deep work, you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. Deep work requires level of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls. By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push you focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration. To succeed with productive meditation, it requires practice to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Rule #3 Quit Social Media&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two important points about our cultures current relationship with social network like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentration. Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it&apos;ll be to maintain focus on something important. The second important point is the impotence with which knowledge workers currently discuss this problem of network tools and attention. Accept that these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be vital to your success and happiness, but at the same time also accepting that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time and attention not to mention personal data should be much more stringent, and that most people should therefore be using many fewer such tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To master the art of deep, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversion that attempt to steal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; you&apos;re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don&apos;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There services are engineered to be addictive, robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals such as deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every tool has something useful to offer, at the same time, it offers negatives as well. Keep using a tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Law of the Vital Few:&lt;/strong&gt; in many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law of the vital few, reminds us that the most important 20 percent or so of these activities provide the bulk of the benefits. The law says that it&apos;s the top two or three such activities you focus on that make most of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal. The key point is that all activities, regardless of their importance, consume your same limited store of time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That you both should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work, which is to reduce the impact of network tools on your ability to perform deep work. Structured hobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your time. If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you&apos;ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured web surfing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Rule #4 Drain the Shallows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You&apos;re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office polities, and personal business that permeate the typical workday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stringy with their time and that&apos;s a good thing. They don&apos;t waste it on things that just don&apos;t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seem in the moment. The value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn&apos;t mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which all of your time is invested in depth. Once you&apos;ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you&apos;ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend much of our day on autopilot, not giving much thought to what we&apos;re doing with our time. To take full advantage of the value of deep work, schedule every minute of your day. If your schedule is disrupted, you should at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day. With structure, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period, the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect, decide in advance that you&apos;re going to do with every minute of your workday. If you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By picking a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-driven unconditional acceptance of the time you put aside for shallow work therefore still exposing yourself to many opportunities, but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixed-schedule productivity:&lt;/strong&gt; A firm goal of not working past a certain time, by ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep and more careful thinking about our organizational habits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Born For This]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our goal is to find work that feels like play, yet also has a meaning and a good paycheck attached to it.

In other words, finding what you were meant to do. There will be many paths and it will take time and effort to find the work we are meant to do. This path is not linear and will have many twists and turns, remember we want to make the right decision along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;JOY-MONEY-FLOW is the 3 key components of a lottery-winning career&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that makes us happy joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that&apos;s financially viable money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that maximizes our unique skills flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the big career decisions you make should get you closer to your ideal blend of joy, money, and flow, and there&apos;s an important distinction between the content of your job and career the kind of work you do and the working condition how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be luckier, take better chances. Remember, it&apos;s not just a numbers game. It&apos;s about managing your risk by picking the right numbers in the first place. Successful people are best positioned for success when they focus not just on improving their skills, but on improving the right skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;re not sure what your &quot;thing&quot; is, when you don&apos;t know quite where to look to find that job or career, that brings you joy, flow, and a good income, the people you talk to every day can help you find it. The goal is to make career changes that bring happiness and income. Finding your dream career isn&apos;t about what you can do, it&apos;s about what you should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side hustle: You don&apos;t have to quit your job to start something on the side, and it doesn&apos;t have to take over your life unless you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle from sociology called &quot;the strength of weakness&quot;, our acquaintance can open more doors to more people, and thus introduce us to more opportunities, than our friends can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success isn&apos;t found completely in persistence; it&apos;s found in working hard and smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which network or platform or tool you use to reach people, the most important goal is to be authentic and genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who succeed in the new economy share four specific characteristics: a body of work product, a group of fans audience, a means of sharing the body of work platform, and a way of getting paid for their work money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work shifting is different from multitasking it&apos;s where you navigate multiple projects and interest by focusing fully on something for a while, and then deliberately shifting to focus fully on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone to win, many others have to lose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smarter Faster Better - The Secrets Of Being Productive In Life And Business]]></title><description><![CDATA[Productivity, put simply, is the name we give our attempts to figure out the best uses of our energy, intellect, and time as we try to seize…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/smarter-faster-better/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/smarter-faster-better/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Productivity, put simply, is the name we give our attempts to figure out the best uses of our energy, intellect, and time as we try to seize the most meaningful rewards with the least wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MOTIVATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation is more like a skill, akin to reading or writing, that can be learned and honed. People can get better at self-motivation by realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is believing we have authority over our action and surroundings. To motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control. When people believe they are in control, they tend to work harder and push themselves more. They are, on average, more confident and overcome setbacks faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to prove to ourselves that we are in control is by making decisions. Each choice, no matter how small, reinforces the perception of control and self-efficacy. The first step in creating drive is giving people opportunities to make choices that provide them with a sense of autonomy and self-determination. Motivation is triggered by making choices that demonstrate to ourselves that we are in control. Self-motivation comes from a strong &quot;internal locus of control&quot;, a belief they could influence their destiny through the choices they made. People with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves for success or failure, rather than assigning responsibility to things outside their influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal locus of control has been linked with academic success, higher self-motivation and social maturity, lower incidence of stress and depression, and longer life span. People with an internal locus of control tend to earn more money, have more friends, stay married longer, and report greater professional success and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal locus of control is a learned skill. Most of us learn it early in life. But some people&apos;s sense of self determination get suppressed by how they grow up, or experiences they&apos;ve had, and they forget how much influence they can have on their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re trying to teach them that you can&apos;t just obey orders. You have to take control and figure things out for yourself. If you give people an opportunity to feel a sense of control and let them practice making choices, they can learn to exert willpower. Once people know how to make self-directed choices into a habit, motivation becomes more automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choices that are most powerful in generating motivation, in other words, are decisions that do two things: They convince us we&apos;re in control and they endow our actions with larger meaning. An internal locus of control emerges when we develop a mental habit of transforming choices into meaningful choices, when we assert that we have authority over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to prove to ourselves that our choices are meaningful. When we start a new task, or confront an unpleasant chore, we should take a moment to ask ourselves &quot;why&quot;. Once we start asking why, those small tasks become pieces of a larger constellation of meaningful projects, goals, and values. We start to recognize how small chores can have outsized emotional rewards, because they prove to ourselves that we are making meaningful choices, that we are genuinely in control of our own lives. Self-motivation is a choice we make because it is part of something bigger and more emotionally rewarding than the immediate task that needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TEAMS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group norms is any group, over time, develops collective norms about appropriate behaviors. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules that govern how we function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the best teams, for instance, leaders encouraged people to speak up. Good norms shared a common attribute: They were all behaviors that created a sense of togetherness while also encouraging people to take a chance. We call it &quot;psychological safety&quot;, a shared belief, held by members of a team, that the group is a safe place for taking risk. It is a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key behavior in good teams is having &quot;high average social sensitivity&quot;, the group were skilled at intuiting how members felt based on their tone of voice, how people held themselves, and the expressions on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best tactic for establishing psychological safety is demonstration by a team leader. The teams with the highest level of psychological safety were also the ones with leaders most likely to model listening and social sensitivity. This is how psychological safety emerges: by giving everyone an equal voice and encouraging social sensitivity among teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FOCUS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental automation lets us choose, almost subconsciously, what to pay attention to and what to ignore. As automation become more common, the risks that our attention spans will fail have risen. Errors are particularly likely when people are forced to toggle between automaticity and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;cognitive tunneling&quot; - a mental glitch that sometimes occurs when our brain are forced to transition abruptly from relaxed automation to panicked attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn techniques to get better at toggling between relaxation and concentration, but they require practice and a desire to remain engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive thinking is at the core of how we allocate our attention, and in many setting, it&apos;s a tremendous asset. This is how we build habits, and its why to-do list and calendar alerts are so helpful: rather than needing to decide what to do next, we can take advantage of our reactive instincts and automatically proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people rely on mental models to some degree. We all tell ourselves stories about how the world works, whether we realize we&apos;re doing it or not. People who know how to manage their attention and who habitually build robust mental models tend to earn more money and get better grades. Anyone can learn to habitually construct mental models by developing a habit of telling ourselves stories about what&apos;s going on around us, we learn to sharpen where our attention goes. If you need to improve your focus and learn to avoid distractions, take a moment to visualize, with as much detail as possible, what you are about to do. Models help us choose where to direct our attention, so we can make decisions, rather than just react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become genuinely productive, we must take control of our attention; we must build mental models that put us firmly in charge. We have to make decisions, and that includes deciding what deserves our attention. The key is forcing yourself to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GOAL SETTING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined and focused people tend to work harder and get tasks done more promptly. They stay married longer and have deeper networks of friends. They often have higher paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality trait known as &quot;the need for cognitive closure&quot; which define as &quot;the desire for a confident judgement on an issue, any confident judgement as compared to confusion and ambiguity.&quot; People who have a strong urge for closure are more likely to be self-disciplined and seen as leaders by their peers. An instinct to make a judgement and then stick with it forestalls needless second-guessing and prolonged debate. All of us crave closure to some degree, making a decision and moving on to the next question feels productive. It feels like progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are risks associated with a high need for closure. When people begin craving the emotional satisfaction that comes from making a decision, when they require a sensation of being productive in order to stay calm, they are more likely to make hasty decisions and less likely to reconsider an unwise choice. A high need for closure has been shown to trigger close-mindedness, authoritarian impulses, and a preference for conflict over cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMART goals, these objectives had to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and based on a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to &apos;do one&apos;s best&apos;. The process of making a goal specific and proving it is achievable involves figuring out the steps it requires, or shifting that goal slightly, if your initial aims turn out to be unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making yourself break a goal into its SMART components is the difference between hoping something come true and figuring out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People respond to the conditions around them. If you&apos;re being constantly told to focus on achievable results, you&apos;re only going to think of achievable goals. You&apos;re not going to dream big. &quot;bullet train thinking&quot;, a stretch goal using dreams to set business targets, with no real idea of how to get there. Numerous academic studies have examined the impact of stretch goals, and have consistently found that forcing people to commit to ambitious, seemingly out-of-reach objectives can spark outsized jumps in innovation and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a stretch goal to inspire, it often needs to be proved with something like the SMART system. For a stretch goal to become more than just an aspiration, we need a disciplined mindset to show us how to turn a far-off objective into a series of realistic short-term aims. Stretch goals, paired with SMART thinking, can help put the impossible within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MANAGING OTHERS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Toyota Production System&quot;, which was producing car of very high quality at very low cost in Japan. The Toyota Production System which in the United States would become known as &quot;lean manufacturing&quot;, relied on pushing decision making to the lowest possible level. The system was built to exploit everyone&apos;s expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our basic philosophy was that no one goes to work wanting to suck. If you put people in a position to succeed, they will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way a business treats workers, was critical to its success. Within most companies, no matter how great the product or loyal the customers, things would eventually fall apart unless employees trusted one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons commitment cultures were successful was because a sense of trust emerged among workers, managers, and customers that enticed everyone to work harder and stick together through the setbacks that are inevitable in any industry. Commitment firms valued making employees happy over quick profits, and as a result, there were higher levels of teamwork and psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a system in place that makes you trust that you can choose the solution you think is best and that your bosses are committed to supporting you if you take a chance that might not pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees work smarter and better when they believe they have more decision-making authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success. A sense of control can fuel motivation, but for that drive to produce insights and innovations, people need to know their suggestions won&apos;t be ignored, that their mistakes won&apos;t be held against them. And they need to know that everyone else has their back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DECISION MAKING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our most important decisions are, in fact, attempts to forecast the future. What fascinated psychologist and economists was how frequently people managed, in the course of their everyday lives, to choose among various futures without becoming paralyzed by the complexities of each choice. What&apos;s more, it appeared that some people were more skilled than others at envisioning various future and choosing the best ones for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilities can help you forecast likelihood, but they can&apos;t guarantee the future. It&apos;s normal, of course, to want to know how things will turn out. It&apos;s scary when we realized how much rides on choices where we can&apos;t predict the future. Making good decision relies on forecasting the future, but forecasting is an imprecise, often terrifying, science because it forces us to confront how much we don&apos;t know. The paradox of learning how to make better decisions is that it requires developing a comfort with doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons on probabilistic thinking instructed participants to think of the future not as what&apos;s going to happen, but rather as a series of possibilities that might occur. The goal was to show people how to turn their intuitions into statistical estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to think probabilistically requires us to question our assumptions and live with uncertainty. To become better at predicting the future, at making good decisions, we need to know the difference between what we hope will happen and what is more and less likely to occur. Probabilities are the closest thing to fortune-telling, but you have to be strong enough to live with what they tell you might occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we have very little data, we can still forecast the future by making assumptions and then skewing them based on what we observe about the world. But it only works if you start with the right assumptions. Our assumptions are based on what we&apos;ve encountered in life, but our experience often draw on biased sample. In particular, we are much more likely to pay attention to or remember successes and forget about failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many successful people, spend an enormous amount of time seeking out the information on failure. We all have a natural proclivity to be optimistic, to ignore our mistakes and forget others&apos; tiny errors. But making good predictions relies on realistic assumptions, and those are based on our experience. If we pay attention only to good news, we&apos;re handicapping ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good choices relies on forecasting the future. Accurate forecasting requires exposing ourselves to as many successes and disappointments as possible. The more you force yourself to envision potential futures, the more you learn about which assumptions are certain or flimsy, the better your odds of making a great decision next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be comfortable not knowing exactly where life is going. All we can do is learn how to make the best decisions that are in front of us, and trust that, over time, the odds will be in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INNOVATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative process, taking proven, conventional ideas from other setting and combining them in new ways. Combination of existing material are centerpieces in theories of creativity, whether in the arts, the sciences, or commercial innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the people we think of as exceptionally creative are essentially intellectual middlemen. They&apos;ve learned how to transfer knowledge between different industries or groups. They&apos;ve seen a lot of different people attack the same problem in different settings, and so they know which kinds of ideas are more likely to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When can create the conditions that help creativity to flourish. We know, for example, that innovation becomes more likely when old ideas are mixed in new ways. We know the odds of success go up when brokers, people with fresh, different perspectives, who have seen ideas in a variety of setting, draw on the diversity within their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a broker and increase the productivity of your own creative process. First, be sensitive to your own experience. Pay attention to how things make you think and feel. Second, recognize that the panic and stress you feel as you try to create isn&apos;t a sign that everything is falling apart. Rather, it&apos;s the condition that help make us flexible enough to seize something new. Finally, remember that the relief accompanying a creative breakthrough, while sweet, can also blind us to seeing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative process is, in fact, a process, something that can be broken down and explained. That&apos;s important, because it means that anyone can become more creative; we can all become innovation brokers. We all have experience and tools, disturbance and tensions that desperation and upheaval and try to see our old ideas in new ways. We just have to learn how to trust ourselves enough to let the creativity out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ABSORBING DATA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google and the internet and all the information we have now, you can find answers to almost anything in seconds, but there&apos;s a difference between finding an answer and understanding what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two decades the amount of information embedded in our daily lives has sky rocketed, if harnessed correctly, data can make our days more productive. In theory, the ongoing explosion in information should make the right answers more obvious. In practice, though, being surrounded by data often makes it harder to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inability to take advantage of data as it becomes more plentiful is called &quot;information blindness.&quot; This refers to our mind&apos;s tendency to stop absorbing data where there&apos;s too much to take in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are exceptionally good at absorbing information, as long as we can break data into a series of smaller and smaller pieces. This ability to digest large amount of information by breaking it into smaller pieces is how our brains turn information into knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to overcome information blindness is to force ourselves to grapple with the data in front of us, to manipulate information by transforming it into a sequence of questions to be answered or choices to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow, when they are trying to solve a problem and design a solution for something; it is a methodical approach to problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who are most successful at learning, those who are able to digest the data surrounding them, who absorb insight embedded in their experiences and take advantage of information flowing past, are the ones who know how to use disfluency to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter new information and want to learn from it, we should force ourselves to do something with the data. When you find a new piece of information, force yourself to engage with it, to use it in an experiment or describe it to a friend, and then you will start building the mental folders that are at the core of learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ego Is The Enemy]]></title><description><![CDATA[I hope you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/ego-is-the-enemy/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/ego-is-the-enemy/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I hope you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you&apos;ve set out to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance, self-centered ambition. The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility, that&apos;s ego. If ego is the voice that tells us we&apos;re better than we really are we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ASPIRE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any given time in life, people find themselves at one of three stages. We&apos;re aspiring to something, trying to make a dent in the universe. We have achieved success, perhaps a little, perhaps a lot. Or we have failed, recently or continually. We&apos;re aspiring until we succeed, we succeed until we fail or until we aspire to more, and after we fail we can begin to aspire or succeed again. Remember to be &lt;strong&gt;Humble&lt;/strong&gt; in our aspirations, &lt;strong&gt;Gracious&lt;/strong&gt; in our success, and &lt;strong&gt;Resilient&lt;/strong&gt; in our failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remove ego, we&apos;re left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility and confidence, Humility and reality are the cure to ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among men who rise to frame and leadership two types are recognizable, those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative, one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TALK, TALK, TALK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong. They work quietly in the corner. They turn their inner turmoil into products and eventually to stillness. They ignore the impulse to seek recognition before they act. They don&apos;t talk much. Or mind the feeling that others, out there in public and enjoying the limelight, are somehow getting the better end of the deal. They are not. They&apos;re too busy working to do anything else. When they do talk, it&apos;s &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who know do not speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who speak do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TO BE OR TO DO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be or to do? Whatever we seek to do in life, reality soon intrudes on our youthful idealism. This reality comes in many names and forms: incentives, commitments, recognition, and politics. In every case, they can quickly redirect us from &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;. From &lt;em&gt;earning&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt;. If we are not careful, we can very easily find ourselves corrupted by the very occupation we wish to serve. It&apos;s about the doing, not the recognition. What is it that I want to accomplish in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road and you’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go. He raised his hand and pointed. “If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd raised his other hand and pointed in another direction. “Or you can go that way and you can do something - something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life, there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BECOME A STUDENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become great, one needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against plus, minus, and equal. To become great and stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on now, and what comes next. They must be always learning. We must all become our own teachers, tutors, and critics. A student is self-critical and self-motivated always trying to improve. The act of being an eternal student kept these men and women humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student. That&apos;s what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DON&apos;T BE PASSIONATE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Passion is seen in those who can tell you in great detail who they intend to become and what their success will be like, they might even be able to tell you specifically when they intend to achieve it or describe to you legitimate and sincere worries they have about the burdens of such accomplishments. They can tell you all the things they&apos;re going to do, or have even begun, but they cannot show you their progress. Because there rarely is any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;. I am so passionate about _&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. What human require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose is \&lt;/em&gt;to_ and &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;. I must do __&lt;/strong&gt;. I was put here to accomplish _&lt;strong&gt;_. I am willing to endure __&lt;/strong&gt; for the sake of this. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself. More than purpose, we also need realism. How are we sure that what we&apos;re doing is moving us forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anteambulo&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;one who clears the path&quot;. Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss. It&apos;s not about kissing ass. It&apos;s about providing the support so that others can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; good. Find a canvas for other people to paint on. Be an &lt;em&gt;anteambulo&lt;/em&gt;. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you&apos;re the least important person in the room, until you change that with results. The canvas strategy is about, helping yourself by helping others. The person who clears that path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RESTRAIN YOURSELF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own path, whatever we aspire to, will in some ways be defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with. Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure. It doesn&apos;t matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how much money you have. When you want to do something, something big and important and meaningful, you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Those who have subdued their ego understands that it doesn&apos;t degrade &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when others treat you poorly; it degrades them. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality. It is natural for any young, ambitious person or simply someone whose ambition is young to get excited and swept up by their thoughts and feeling. Especially in a world that tells us to keep and promote a &quot;personal brand.&quot; We&apos;re required to tell stories in order to sell our work and our talents, and after enough time, forget where the line is that separates our fictions from reality. Ultimately this disability will paralyze us. Or it will become a wall between us and the information we need to do our jobs. Living clearly and presently takes courage. Don&apos;t live in the haze of the abstract, live with the tangible and real, even if it&apos;s uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians believe that pride is a sin because it is a lie, it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man. You need only to care about your career to understand that pride, even in real accomplishments, is a distraction and a deluder. Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. Pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one. Let&apos;s call that attitude what it is: fraud. If you&apos;re doing the work and putting in the time, you won&apos;t need to cheat, you won&apos;t need to overcompensate. What we don&apos;t protect ourselves against are people and things that make us feel good, or rather, too good. We must prepare for pride and kill it early, or it will kill what we aspire to. Privately thinking you&apos;re better than others is still pride. It&apos;s still dangerous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proud man is always looking down on things and people; of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WORK, WORK, WORK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be both a craftsman and an artist. To cultivate a product of labor and industry instead of just a product of the mind. It&apos;s here where the abstraction meets the road and the real, where we trade thinking and talking for working. Sure, you get it. You know that all things require work and that work might be quite difficult. But do you really understand? Not work until you get your big break, not work until you make a name for yourself, but work, work, work, forever and ever. There is no end zone. We&apos;re simply talking about a lot of hours, that to get where we want to go isn&apos;t about brilliance, but continual effort. You can lie to yourself, saying that you put in the time, or pretend that you&apos;re working, but eventually someone will show up. You&apos;ll be tested. And quite possibly found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am going to be myself, the best version of that self. I am in this for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be.&quot; To &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes ego is suppressed on the ascent. Sometimes an idea is so powerful or timing is so perfect or one is born into wealth and power that it can temporarily support or even compensate for a massive ego. The worst disease which can afflict business executives in their work is not as popularly supposed, alcoholism; it&apos;s egotism. Whether in middle management or top management, unbridled personal egotism blinds a man to the realities around him; more and more he comes to live in a world of his own imagination; and because he sincerely believes he can do no wrong, he becomes a menace to the men and women who have to work under his direction. Without the right values, success is brief. If we wish to do more than flash, if we wish to last, then it is time to understand how to battle this new form of ego and what values and principles are required in order to beat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we first succeed, we will find ourselves in new situations, facing new problems. It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. With accomplishment comes a growing pressure to pretend that we know more than we do. To pretend we already know everything. That&apos;s the worry and the risk, thinking that we&apos;re set and secure, when in reality understanding and mastery is a fluid continual process. No matter what you&apos;ve done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you&apos;re not still learning, you&apos;re already dying. Learn from &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning and even, occasionally, being shown up to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DON&apos;T TELL YOURSELF A STORY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It&apos;s also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. It turns our life into a story and turns us into caricatures, while we still have to live it. There is real danger in believing it when people use the work &quot;genius&quot; and it&apos;s even more dangerous when we let hubris tell ourselves we are one. The same goes for any label that comes along with a career: are we suddenly a &quot;film-maker,&quot; &quot;writer,&quot; &quot;investor,&quot; &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; or &quot;executive&quot; because we&apos;ve accomplished one thing? These labels put you at odds not just with reality, but with the real strategy that made you successful in the first place. From that place, we might think that success in the future is just the natural next part of the story, when really, it&apos;s rooted in work, creativity, persistence, and luck. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution and on executing with excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO YOU?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re never happy with what we have, we want what others have too. We want to have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than everyone else. We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we&apos;ve achieved it, we lost sight of our priorities. Ego sways us, and can ruin us. All of us waste precious life doing things we don&apos;t like, to prove ourselves to people we don&apos;t respect, and to get things we don&apos;t want. Ego undermines greatness by deluding its holder. Each one of us has a unique potential and purpose: that means that we&apos;re the only ones who can evaluate and set the terms of our lives. Far too often, we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet, and a result, squander our very potential and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not about beating the other guy, it’s not about having more than the others. It&apos;s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It&apos;s about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you&apos;re capable of in what you choose. That&apos;s it. No more and no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With success, particularly power, come some of the greatest and most dangerous delusions: entitlement, control, and paranoia. The problem lies in the path that got us to success in the first place. What we&apos;ve accomplished often required feats of raw power and force of will. Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of the people around us. Persistence and courage in the face of ridiculous odds are partially irrational traits. A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their power and reach. Ego is its own worst enemy, it hurts the ones we love and our families and friends suffer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MANAGING YOUSELF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. What matters is that you learn how to manage yourself and others, before your industry eats you alive. Responsibility requires a readjustment and increased clarity and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they start, before they have won, a team is innocent. &quot;Innocent Climb&quot; happens when the conditions are right, they come together, they watch out for each other and work together toward their collective goal. After a team starts to win and media attention begins, players calculate their own importance. The Innocent Climb is almost always followed by the &quot;Disease of Me.&quot; For us, it&apos;s beginnings to think that we&apos;re better, that we&apos;re special, that our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else&apos;s that no one could possibly understand. Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition. We never earn the right to be greedy or to pursue our interests at the expense of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego tells us that meaning comes from activity, that being the center of attention is the only way to matter. Walk onto ancient battlefield or a place of historical significance. Look at the statues and you can&apos;t help but see how similar the people look, how little has changed since then, since before, and how it will be forever after. It&apos;s the sense that others have been here before you, generations of them, in fact. In those moments, we have a sense of the immensity of the world, we are a piece of this great universe and a process. Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I look up in the universe, I know I&apos;m small, but I&apos;m also big. I&apos;m big because I&apos;m connected to the universe and the universe is connected to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MAINTAIN YOUR SOBRIETY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobriety is the command of oneself. We have to fight to stay sober, despite the many different forces swirling around our ego. Ego clouds the mind precisely when it needs to be clear. Sobriety is a counterbalance, a hangover cure. An elimination of the unnecessary and the destructive. No more obsessing about your image; treating people beneath you or above you with contempt; needing first-class trappings and lording over, condescending, and marveling at your own awesomeness or self-anointed importance. Sobriety is the counter weight that must balance out success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FOR WHAT OFTEN COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must manage yourself in order to maintain your success. We can use the golden mean to navigate our ego and our desire to achieve. What&apos;s difficult is to apply the right amount of pressure, at the right time, in the right way, for the right period of time, in the right car, going in the right direction. Behind every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled, but when egotism take hold, we lost track of our goal and end up somewhere we never intended. We know what decisions we must make to avoid that ignominious, even pathetic end: protecting our sobriety, eschewing greed and paranoia, staying humble, retaining our sense of purpose, connecting to the larger world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting power make us delusional and instead of taking what we have for granted, we&apos;d be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called failure. In order to taste success again, we&apos;ve got to understand what led to this moment or these years of difficulty, what went wrong and why. We must deal with the situation in order to move pass it. The way through, the way to rise again, requires a reorientation and increased self-awareness. Ego loves the idea that something fair or not. We don&apos;t need pity, our own or anyone else&apos;s, we need purpose, poise, and patience. The great failing is &quot;to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, present this choice: Alive time. Dead time. As they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? Cast down your bucket where you are. Make use of what&apos;s around you. Don&apos;t let stubbornness make a bad situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly, yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. This reality rings essentially true for everyone in every kind of life. We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort. It&apos;s far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When the effort, not the results, good or bad, is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do our best to becoming the best that you are capable of becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FIGHT CLUB MOMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to hit bottom. Almost everyone does in their own way, at some point. We surround ourselves with bullshit. With distractions, with lies about what makes us happy and what&apos;s important. We become people we shouldn&apos;t become and engage in destructive, awful behaviors. We&apos;d call that hell, and on occasion we all spend some time there. How much better it would be to spare ourselves these experiences, but sometimes it&apos;s the only way the blind can be made to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in those moments, when the break exposes something unseen before, that you were forced to make eye contact with a thing called Truth. No longer could you hide and pretend. The world can show you the truth, but no one can force you to accept it. But change begins by hearing the criticism and the words of the people around you. In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DRAW THE LINE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People make mistakes all the time. We take risks. We mess up. The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It&apos;s a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve failed and let&apos;s even say it was your fault. Are you going to make it worse? Or are you going to emerge from this with your dignity and character intact? Only ego thinks embarrassment or failure are more than what they are. When we lose, we have a choice: Are we going to make this a lose-lose situation for ourselves and everyone involved? Or will it be a lose... and then win?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any given time in the circle of life, we may be aspiring, succeeding or failing. With wisdom, we understand that these positions are transitory, not statement about your value as a human being. When success begin to slip from your fingers, for whatever reason, the response isn&apos;t to grip and claw so hard that you shatter it to pieces. It&apos;s to understand that you must work yourself back to the aspirational phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scoreboard was not the judge of whether he or the team had achieved success, that wasn&apos;t what constituted &quot;winning.&quot; A characteristic of how great people think. It&apos;s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don&apos;t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else&apos;s. Your potential, the absolute best you&apos;re capable of, that&apos;s the metric to measure yourself against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ALWAYS LOVE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have stuff that pisses us off. The more successful or powerful we are, the more there will be that we think we need to protect in terms of our legacy, image, and influence. If we&apos;re not careful, however, we can end up wasting an incredible amount of time trying to keep the world from displeasing or disrespecting us. You know what is a better response to an attack or a slight or something you don&apos;t like? Love. You could at the very least try to let it go. You could try to shake your head and laugh about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In failure or adversity, it&apos;s so easy to hate. Hate defers blame. It makes someone else responsible. It&apos;s a distraction too. Does this get us any closer to where we want to be? No. It just keeps us where we are or worse, arrests our development entirely. Meanwhile, love is right there. Egoless, open, positive, vulnerable, peaceful, and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We must strip ourselves of the ego that protects and suffocates us, because hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence. It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and objective center of your life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All great men and women went through difficulties to get to where they are, all of them made mistakes. They found within those experiences some benefit, even if it was simply the realization that they were not infallible and that things would not always go their way. They found that self-awareness was the way out and through, if they hadn&apos;t they wouldn&apos;t have gotten better and they wouldn&apos;t have been able to rise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to aspire or seek out of ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have success without ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To push through failure with strength, not ego.&lt;/p&gt;

Without one, chances are you&apos;ll end up at an unintended destination due to drafting. &quot;The drift&quot;, a metaphor for understanding how we arrive at destinations we don&apos;t consciously choose. Life Planning is the exact opposite of the drift, it&apos;s about proactivity and taking responsibility. The earlier you get started, the most influence you can have on getting the life you want - financially, relationally, physically, and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Life Plan is a short-written document, usually eight to fifteen pages long. It is created by you and for you. It describes how you want to be remembered. It articulates your personal priorities. It provides the specific actions necessary to take you from where you are to where you want to be in every major area of your life. It is most of all a living document that you will tweak and adjust as necessary for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t always choose what happens to you. Accidents and tragedies happen. What you can do is choose how your respond to those situations. One of the best ways to begin is to ask yourself the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Three Powerful Questions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I want to be remembered?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What matter most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I get from here to where I want to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of a Life Plan are &lt;strong&gt;Clarifying Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling you to set your priorities and understand how they work together and when they don&apos;t. &lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Balance&lt;/strong&gt; by giving appropriate attention to each of the various categories of your life. &lt;strong&gt;Filtering Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;, reprioritize and reorganize life which gives courage to manage opportunities rather than being managed by them. &lt;strong&gt;Facing Reality&lt;/strong&gt;, the truth is, you can&apos;t improve what you won&apos;t face and own. &lt;strong&gt;Envisioning the Future&lt;/strong&gt;, you need to acknowledge where you are, but you also need to see clearly where you are going. Lastly &lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Regret&lt;/strong&gt;, while you can&apos;t control everything, you can control more than you think, and you can live your life with a plan that will dramatically improve your chances of ending up at a destination you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we think about our legacy, we need to start with the end. Our days add up to a lifetime. At the end of that life, what will those closest to you say, what will they remember, how will they assess your legacy? Truth is, everyone is in the process of creating and leaving a legacy. Our legacy comprises the spiritual, intellectual, relational, vocational, and social capital we pass on.
You start by writing your Eulogy, first by identifying your key relationships. Describe how you want to be remembered by each group of relationships. Be sure to make your legacy statement as compelling as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Accounts, your life is an interrelated collection of interests, responsibilities, dreams, and activities. This is divided into three circles - Circle of Being solely on you in relation to yourself, Circle of Relating collection of activities centered on you in relation to others, and Circle of Doing collection of activities dealing with you in relation to your output. Write out your Life Accounts and remember that they are unique to you and are interrelated. Once you have your list of Life Accounts, determine the condition of each Life Account. They can be growing balance more than you need, consistent balance have what you need, or declining balance less than you need. Your Life is a collection of accounts and each of them requires the right attentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we have to attend to ourselves first in order to be spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, and physically available to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Break each Life Account down into five sections&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose Statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envisioned Future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspiring Quote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific Commitments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section should be a series of bullets that are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Time-bound SMART.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The day of creating your Life Plan spend the whole day working on it&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Your Attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind Yourself of the Goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust the Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to Your Heart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Focused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to review, tweak, and revisit it regularly if it is to actually shape your life. Reviewing your Life Plan will help expand your working memory and thereby increase the chances you&apos;ll achieve your goals. Start by reading your Plan out loud daily for the first ninety days. Then review your Plan weekly while tweaking it Quarterly. Always revise your Plan yearly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Quick Guide&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write Your Eulogy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish Your Life Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the Condition of Your Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize Your Life Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out Each Account&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DESIRE - THE STARTING POINT OF ALL ACHIEVEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desiring&lt;/em&gt; riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which &lt;em&gt;does not recognize failure&lt;/em&gt;, will bring riches. If you truly &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; riches so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. Your &lt;strong&gt;BURNING DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; comes from your dreams, you must take action until that dream is a physical reality. There is a difference between &lt;strong&gt;WISHING&lt;/strong&gt; for a thing and being &lt;strong&gt;READY&lt;/strong&gt; to receive it. No one is &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt; for a thing, until he &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; he can acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Wage by Jessie B. Rittenhouse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bargained with Life for a penny,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Life would pay no more,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I begged at evening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I counted my scanty store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Life is a just employer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives you what you ask,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you have set the wages,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you must bear the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked for a menial&apos;s hire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only to learn, dismayed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That any wage I had asked of Life,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life would have willingly paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAITH - VISUALIZATION OF, AND BELIEF IN ATTAINMENT OF DESIRE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAITH&lt;/strong&gt; is the head chemist of the mind. The emotions of &lt;strong&gt;FAITH, LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;SEX&lt;/strong&gt; are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is purely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence. The principle of auto-suggestion assumes in the transmutation of desire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: &lt;strong&gt;FAITH&lt;/strong&gt; is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, given feeling AND MIXED WITH FAITH&lt;/strong&gt;, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart. Understand that the subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to encourage the &lt;em&gt;positive emotions&lt;/em&gt; as dominating forces of your mind, and discourage - and &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every man is what he is, because of the &lt;strong&gt;DOMINATING THOUGHTS&lt;/strong&gt; which he permits to occupy his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SELF-CONFIDENCE FORMULA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;THINKING - by Walter D. Wintle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you are beaten, you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you dare not, you don&apos;t,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like to win, but you think you can&apos;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost certain you won&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you&apos;ll lose, you&apos;re lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For out of the world we find,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success begins with a fellow&apos;s will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s all in the state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you are outclassed, you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve got to think high to rise,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve got to be sure of yourself before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ever win a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&apos;s battles don&apos;t always go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the stronger or faster man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon or late the man who wins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AUTO-SUGESSTION - THE MEDIUM FOR INFLUENCING THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTO-SUGGESTION&lt;/strong&gt; is a term which applies to all suggestions and all self-administered stimuli which reach one&apos;s mind through the five senses. Through the dominating thoughts which one &lt;em&gt;permits&lt;/em&gt; to remain in the conscious mind, whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is immaterial, the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and influences it with these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO THOUGHT&lt;/strong&gt;, whether it be negative or positive, &lt;strong&gt;CAN ENTER THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTO-SUGGESTION&lt;/strong&gt;, with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE - PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OR OBSERVATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of knowledge. One is general, the other is specialized. &lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE&lt;/strong&gt; will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical &lt;strong&gt;PLANS OF ACTION&lt;/strong&gt;, to the &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITE END&lt;/strong&gt; of accumulation of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is only &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; power. It becomes power only when and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can be sure of your ability to transmute &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; into its monetary equivalent, you will require &lt;strong&gt;SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE&lt;/strong&gt; of the service, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who can organize and direct a &quot;Master Mind&quot; group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation of money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized knowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who stops studying merely because he has finished school is forever hopelessly doomed to mediocrity, no matter what may be his calling. The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the &lt;strong&gt;IMAGINATION&lt;/strong&gt;, and seek a more profitable outlet for your personal services, the &lt;strong&gt;IDEA&lt;/strong&gt; is capable of yielding an income far greater than that of the &quot;average&quot; doctor, lawyer, or engineer. Back of all &lt;strong&gt;IDEAS&lt;/strong&gt; is specialized knowledge. Capability means &lt;strong&gt;IMAGINATION&lt;/strong&gt;, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with &lt;strong&gt;IDEAS&lt;/strong&gt;, in the form of &lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZED PLANS&lt;/strong&gt; designed to yield riches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IMAGINATION - THE WORKSHOP OF THE MIND&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, is given shape, form, and &lt;strong&gt;ACTION&lt;/strong&gt; through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind. It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN&apos;S ONLY LIMITATION&lt;/strong&gt;, within reason, &lt;strong&gt;LIES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes and are products of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE&lt;/strong&gt; is the starting point from which one must begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDEAS CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO CASH THROUGH THE POWER OF DEFINITE PURPOSE, PLUS DEFINITE PLANS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no standard price on ideas. The creator of ideas makes his own price, and, if he is smart, gets it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Imaginative Faculty Functions In Two Forms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYNTHETIC IMAGINATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Through this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CREATIVE IMAGINATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Earth, every one of the billions of individual cells of your body, and every atom of matter, &lt;em&gt;began as an intangible form of energy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there&apos;s a will, there&apos;s a way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ORGANIZED PLANNING - THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF DESIRE INTO ACTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the form of &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the &lt;strong&gt;IMAGINATION&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;PLANS&lt;/strong&gt; for its transition are created and organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the creation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Before forming your &quot;Master Mind&quot; alliance, decide what advantages, and benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for their cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Arrange to meet with the member of your &quot;Master Mind&quot; group at least twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected the necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Maintain &lt;strong&gt;PERFECT HARMONY&lt;/strong&gt; between yourself and every member of your &quot;Master Mind&quot; group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and knowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the cooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to accumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other member of your &quot;Master Mind&quot; group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money - nor in any other undertaking - without plans which are practical and workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that there is something wrong with your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING &quot;TEMPORARY DEFEAT.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A QUITTER NEVER WINS AND A WINNER NEVER QUITS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of people in the world. One type is known as &lt;strong&gt;LEADERS&lt;/strong&gt; and the other as &lt;strong&gt;FOLLOWERS&lt;/strong&gt;. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They became great leaders because they were &lt;strong&gt;INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Major Attributes Of Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNWAVERING COURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; based upon knowledge of self, and of one&apos;s occupation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SELF-CONTROL&lt;/strong&gt;. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE&lt;/strong&gt;. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PLANS&lt;/strong&gt;. The successful leader must plan his work and &lt;em&gt;work his plan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A PLEASING PERSONALITY&lt;/strong&gt;. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING&lt;/strong&gt;. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers, moreover, he must understand them and their problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASTERY OF DETAIL&lt;/strong&gt;. Successful leadership call for mastery of details of the leader&apos;s position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/strong&gt;. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COOPERATION&lt;/strong&gt;. Leadership calls for &lt;strong&gt;POWER&lt;/strong&gt;, and power calls for &lt;strong&gt;COOPERATION&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leadership-by-consent&lt;/em&gt; of the followers is the only brand which can endure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QQS Rating&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;QUALITY&lt;/em&gt; of service shall be construed to mean the performance of every detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner possible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;QUANTITY&lt;/em&gt; of service shall be understood to mean the &lt;strong&gt;HABIT&lt;/strong&gt; of rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of services rendered as greater skill is developed through practice and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPIRIT&lt;/em&gt; of service shall be construed to mean the &lt;strong&gt;HABIT&lt;/strong&gt; of agreeable, harmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one has a personality which &lt;strong&gt;PLEASES&lt;/strong&gt;, and renders service in a spirit of &lt;strong&gt;HARMONY&lt;/strong&gt;, these assets often make up for deficiencies in both the &lt;strong&gt;QUALITY&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;QUANTITY&lt;/strong&gt; of service one renders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thirty Major Causes Of Failure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED PURPOSE IN LIFE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INSUFFICIENT EDUCTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ILL HEALTH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES DURING CHILDHOOD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PROCRASTINATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF PERSISTENCE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEGATIVE PERSONALITY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR &quot;SOMETHING FOR NOTHING&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OVER-CAUTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF ENTHUSIASM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INTOLERANCE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INTEMPERANCE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED THROUGH SELF EFFORT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EGOTISM AND VANITY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACK OF CAPITAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy of life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual self-analysis is an essential in the effective marketing of personal services. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to move forward even if the progress is slow. Your annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you can include in your New Year&apos;s Resolutions any improvements which the analysis indicates should be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SELF-ANALYSIS QUESTIONNAIRE FOR PERSONAL INVENTORY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I attained the goal which I established as my objective for this year? You should work with a definite yearly objective to be attained as a part of your major life objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I delivered service of the best possible &lt;strong&gt;QUALITY&lt;/strong&gt; of which I was capable, or could I have improved any part of this service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I delivered service in the greatest possible &lt;strong&gt;QUANTITY&lt;/strong&gt; of which I was capable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the spirit of my conduct been harmonious, and cooperative at all times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I permitted the habit of &lt;strong&gt;PROCRASTINATION&lt;/strong&gt; to decrease my efficiency, and if so, to what extent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I improved my &lt;strong&gt;PERSONALITY&lt;/strong&gt;, and if so, in what ways?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENT&lt;/strong&gt; in following my plans through to completion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I reached &lt;strong&gt;DECISIONS PROMPTLY AND DEFINITELY&lt;/strong&gt; on all occasions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I permitted any one or more of the six basic fears to decrease my efficiency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been either &quot;over-cautious,&quot; or &quot;under-cautious?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has my relationship with my associates in work been pleasant, or unpleasant? If it has been unpleasant, has the fault been partly, or wholly mine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I dissipated any of my energy through lack of &lt;strong&gt;CONCENTRATION&lt;/strong&gt; of effort?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been open minded and tolerant in connection with all subjects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what way have I improved my ability to render service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been intemperate in any of my habits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I expressed, either openly or secretly, and from of &lt;strong&gt;EGOTISM&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has my conduct toward my associates been such that has induced them to &lt;strong&gt;RESPECT&lt;/strong&gt; me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have my opinions and &lt;strong&gt;DECISIONS&lt;/strong&gt; been based upon guesswork, or accuracy of analysis and &lt;strong&gt;THOUGHT&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I followed the habit of budgeting my time, my expenses, and my income, and have I been conservative in these budgets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time have I devoted to &lt;strong&gt;UNPROFITABLE&lt;/strong&gt; effort which I might have used to better advantage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many I &lt;strong&gt;RE-BUDGET&lt;/strong&gt; my time, and change my habits so I will be more efficient during the coming year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been guilty of any conduct which was not approved by my conscience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways have I rendered &lt;strong&gt;MORE SERVICE AND BETTER SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt; than I was paid to render?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I been unfair to anyone, and if so, in what way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I had been the purchaser of my own services for the year, would I be satisfied with my purchase?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I in the right vocation, and if not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the purchaser of my services been satisfied with the service I have rendered, and if not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my present rating on the fundamental principles of success? Make this rating fairly, and frankly, and have it checked by someone who is courageous enough to do it accurately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have lost their fortunes, and those who are just beginning to earn money, have nothing but personal services to offer in return for riches, therefore it is essential that they have available the practical information needed to market services to best advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small, let us remember, &lt;em&gt;all of us&lt;/em&gt;, that we live in a country where &lt;em&gt;every law-abiding citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled anywhere in the world&lt;/em&gt;. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes &lt;strong&gt;FOOD, CLOTHING&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;SHELTER&lt;/strong&gt;, the three basic necessities of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service. No system has ever been created by which men can legally acquire riches through mere force of numbers, or without giving in return an equivalent value of one form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate riches that any honest person may require. We shall prefer to continue with our &lt;strong&gt;FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF DEED&lt;/strong&gt;, AND &lt;strong&gt;FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR RICHES&lt;/strong&gt;, The &quot;System&quot; denies no one this right, but it does not, and cannot promise &lt;strong&gt;SOMETHING FOR NOTHING&lt;/strong&gt;, because the system, itself, is irrevocably controlled by the &lt;strong&gt;LAW OF ECONOMICS&lt;/strong&gt; which neither recognizes nor tolerates for long &lt;strong&gt;GETTING WITHOUT GIVING&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DECISION - THE MASTERY OF PROCRASTINATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCURATE&lt;/strong&gt; analysis of over 25,000 men and women who had experienced failure, disclosed the face that &lt;strong&gt;LACK OF DECISION&lt;/strong&gt; was near the head of the list of the 30 major causes of &lt;strong&gt;FAILURE&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;PROCRASTINATION&lt;/strong&gt;, the opposite of &lt;strong&gt;DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;, is a common enemy which practically every man must conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get into the habit of &lt;strong&gt;REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY&lt;/strong&gt;, and of changing these decisions &lt;strong&gt;SLOWLY&lt;/strong&gt;, if, and when they were changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions are the cheapest commodities on Earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by &quot;opinions&quot; when you reach &lt;strong&gt;DECISIONS&lt;/strong&gt;, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting &lt;strong&gt;YOUR OWN DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; into money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a brain and mind of your own, &lt;strong&gt;USE IT&lt;/strong&gt;, and reach your own decisions. Keep your eyes and ears wide open - and your mouth &lt;strong&gt;CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;, if you wish to acquire the habit of prompt &lt;strong&gt;DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;. Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through &lt;em&gt;modesty and silence&lt;/em&gt;. Let one of your first decisions be to &lt;strong&gt;KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND OPEN EARS AND EYES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find only the eternal laws of Nature. These laws are available to every person who has the &lt;strong&gt;FAITH&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;COURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; to use them. Those who reach &lt;strong&gt;DECISIONS&lt;/strong&gt; promptly and definitely, know what they want, and generally get it. The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDECISION&lt;/strong&gt; is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on permanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even through college, without &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any job that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into the habit of &lt;strong&gt;INDECISION&lt;/strong&gt;. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for wages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF DECISION&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION&lt;/strong&gt;, and the knowledge of how to choose an employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who reaches a &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITE DECISION&lt;/strong&gt; to procure the particular job, and make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he stakes his &lt;strong&gt;ECONOMIC FREEDOM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chapter on Organized Planning, you will find complete instructions for marketing every type of personal services. You will find also detailed information on how to choose the employer you prefer, and the particular job you desire. These instructions will be of no value to you &lt;strong&gt;UNLESS YOU DEFINITELY DECIDE&lt;/strong&gt; to organize them into a plan of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PERSISTENCE - THE SUSTAINED EFFORT NECESSARY TO INDUCE FAITH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt; is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the &lt;strong&gt;POWER OF WILL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will-power and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible pair. The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes overboard, and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry on &lt;strong&gt;DESPITE&lt;/strong&gt; all opposition, until they attain their goal. The ease with which lack of persistence may be conquered will depend &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; upon the &lt;strong&gt;INTENSITY OF ONE&apos;S DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;. If you find yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness may be remedied by building a stronger fire under your desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt;, you will be defeated, even before you start. With &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt; you will win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENT&lt;/strong&gt; no matter how slowly you may, at first, have to move. &lt;strong&gt;WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people know from experience the soundness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat as being anything more than temporary. They are the ones whose &lt;strong&gt;DESIRES&lt;/strong&gt; are so &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENTLY APPLIED&lt;/strong&gt; that defeat is finally changed into victory. We who stand on the side-lines of Life see the overwhelmingly large number who go down in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who take the punishment of defeat &lt;em&gt;as an urge to greater effort&lt;/em&gt;. These, fortuneately, never learn to accept Life&apos;s reverse gear. But what we &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT SEE&lt;/strong&gt;, what most of us never suspect of existing, is the silent but irresistible &lt;strong&gt;POWER&lt;/strong&gt; which comes to the rescue of those who fight on in the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we call it &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt;. One thing we all know, if one does not proccess &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt;, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated, like all states of mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DESIRE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SELF-RELIANCE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PLANS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CO-OPERATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WILL-POWER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HABIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study the list below carefully, and face yourself squarely &lt;strong&gt;IF YOU REALLY WISH TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SYMPTOMS OF LACK OF PERSISTENCE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to recognize and to clearly define exactly what one wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procrastination with or without cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of interest in acquiring specialized knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indecision the habit of &quot;passing the buck&quot; on all occasions, instead of facing issues squarely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of relying upon alibis instead of creating definite plans for the solution of problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this affliction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indifference, usually reflected in one&apos;s readiness to compromise on all occasions, rather than meet opposition and fight it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of blaming others for one&apos;s mistakes, and accepting unfavorable circumstances as being unavoidable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEAKNESS OF DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, due to neglect in the choice of &lt;strong&gt;MOTIVES&lt;/strong&gt; that impel action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness, even eagerness, to quit at the first sign of defeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of &lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZED PLANS&lt;/strong&gt;, placed in writing where they may be analyzed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of neglecting to move on ideas, or to grasp opportunity when it presents itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WISHING&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;WILLING&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of compromising with &lt;strong&gt;POVERTY&lt;/strong&gt; instead of aiming at riches. General absence of ambition to &lt;em&gt;be, to do&lt;/em&gt;, and to &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching for all the short-cuts to riches, trying to &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; without &lt;strong&gt;GIVING&lt;/strong&gt; a fair equivalent, usually reflected in the habit of gambling, endeavoring to drive &quot;sharp&quot; bargains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEAR OF CRITICISM&lt;/strong&gt;, failure to create plans and to put them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOST IDEAS ARE STILL-BORN, AND NEED THE BREATH OF LIFE INJECTED INTO THEM THROUGH DEFINITE PLANS OF IMMEDIATE ACTION&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only &quot;break&quot; anyone can afford to rely upon is a self-made &quot;break.&quot; These come through the application of &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt;. The starting point is &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the first hundred people you meet, ask them what they want most in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you press them for an answer, some will say &lt;strong&gt;SECURITY&lt;/strong&gt;, many will say &lt;strong&gt;MONEY&lt;/strong&gt;, a few will say &lt;strong&gt;HAPPINESS&lt;/strong&gt;, other will say &lt;strong&gt;FAME AND POWER&lt;/strong&gt;, and still others will say &lt;strong&gt;SOCIAL RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING, DANCE&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;WRITE&lt;/strong&gt;, but none of them will be able to define these terms, or give the slightest indication of a &lt;strong&gt;PLAN&lt;/strong&gt; by which they hope to attain these vaguely expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant &lt;strong&gt;PERSISTENCE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Four Simple Steps To Develop Persistence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS ACTION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four steps are essential for success in all walks of life. The entire purpose of the thirteen principles of this philosophy is to enable one to take these four steps as a matter of &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POWER OF THE MASTER MIND - THE DRIVING FORCE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POWER&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for success in the accumulation of money. &lt;strong&gt;PLANS&lt;/strong&gt; are inert and useless, without sufficient &lt;strong&gt;POWER&lt;/strong&gt; to translate them into &lt;strong&gt;ACTION&lt;/strong&gt;. Power, as the term is here used, refers to &lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZED&lt;/strong&gt; effort, sufficient to enable an individual to transmute &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; into its monetary equivalent. &lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZED&lt;/strong&gt; effort is produced through the coordination of effort of two or more people, who work toward a &lt;strong&gt;DEFINITE&lt;/strong&gt; end, in a spirit of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POWER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY! POWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE RETENTION OF MONEY AFTER IT HAS BEEN ACCUMULATED!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Master Mind&quot; may be defined as: &quot;Coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature. When the mind of two people are coordinated in a &lt;strong&gt;SPIRIT OF HARMONY&lt;/strong&gt;, the spiritual unit of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the &quot;psychic&quot; phase of the Master Mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENERGY&lt;/strong&gt; is Nature&apos;s universal set of building blocks, out of which she constructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of animal and vegetable life. Nature&apos;s building blocks are available to man in the energy involved in &lt;strong&gt;THINKING!&lt;/strong&gt; Man&apos;s brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs energy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and fills the entire universe. It is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery. A group of brains coordinated or connected in a spirit of harmony, will provide more thought-energy than a single brain, just as a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men take on the nature and the habits and the &lt;strong&gt;POWER OF THOUGHT&lt;/strong&gt; of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two or more people coordinate in a spirit of &lt;strong&gt;HARMONY&lt;/strong&gt;, and work toward a definite objective, they place themselves in position, through that alliance, to absorb power directly from the great universal storehouse of Infinite Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When riches take the place of poverty, the change is usually brought about through well conceived and carefully executed &lt;strong&gt;PLANS&lt;/strong&gt;. Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it, because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be &quot;attracted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody can wish for riches,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and most people do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but only a few know that a definite plan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plus a burning desire for wealth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are the only dependable means of accumulating wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE MYSTERY OF SEX TRANSMUTATION - THE TENTH STEP TOWARD RICHES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the word &quot;transmute&quot; is, in simple language, &quot;the changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another.&quot; Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, man develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotion of sex is an &quot;irresistible force,&quot; against which there can be no such opposition as an &quot;immovable body.&quot; When driven by this emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ten Mind Stimuli&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The desire for sex expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-suggestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narcotics and alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli, that transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth sense is &quot;Creative Imagination.&quot; The faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usually happens by mere accident. The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. The &quot;sixth sense&quot; is the faculty which marks the difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great because they acquire the habit of relying upon the &quot;still small voice&quot; which speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex energy is the creative energy for all genii, &lt;em&gt;There never has been, and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex&lt;/em&gt;. Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the creative faculty of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are filled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age of man. Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn if he ever learns, the art of sex transmutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted and totally destructive. When driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of &lt;strong&gt;LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; is used with the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformation means, &quot;a change of heart.&quot; It does not mean a &quot;change of head.&quot; A man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but &lt;strong&gt;GENUINE REFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt; comes only through a change of heart-through a &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to heights of super achievement, when combined, these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one&apos;s mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the &lt;em&gt;dominating&lt;/em&gt; thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one&apos;s mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one&apos;s thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one&apos;s very soul, even after the fire has been subdued by time and circumstance. Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, ,and influence long after the source of stimulation has faded. Every person, who has been moved by &lt;strong&gt;GENUINE LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;, knows that it leaves enduring traces upon the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane. When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are removed. Then a genius has been born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very old saying that &quot;a man&apos;s wife may either make him or break him,&quot; but the reason is not always understood. The &quot;making&quot; and &quot;breaking&quot; is the result of the wife&apos;s understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions of love, sex, and romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&apos;s greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND - THE CONNECTING LINK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND&lt;/strong&gt; consists of a field of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet. You may &lt;strong&gt;VOLUNTARILY&lt;/strong&gt; plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SUBCONSIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT.&lt;/strong&gt; Through a method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes one&apos;s desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most practical media by which this end may be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, your subconscious mind functions voluntarily, &lt;em&gt;whether you make any effort to influence it or not.&lt;/em&gt; This, naturally, suggests to you that thoughts of fear and poverty, and all negative thoughts serve as stimuli to your subconscious mind, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt;, you master these impulses and give it more desirable food upon which it may feed. You are now engaged in trying to help shut oil the flow of negative impulses, and to aid in voluntarily influencing your subconscious mind, through positive impulses of &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical equivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass through the imagination, and be mixed with faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;You Never Can Tell by Ella Wheeler Wilcox&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never can tell when you send a word,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an arrow shot from a bow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By an archer blind, be it cruel or kind,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just where it may chance to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may pierce the breast of your dearest friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tipped with its poison or balm,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a stranger&apos;s heart in life&apos;s great mart,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may carry its pain or its calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never can tell when you do an act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just what the result will be;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with every deed you are sowing a seed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the harvest you may not see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each kindly act is an acorn dropped&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God&apos;s productive soil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not know, but the tree shall grow,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With shelter for those who toil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never can tell what your thoughts will do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bringing you hate or love;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thoughts are things, and their airy wings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are swifter than carrier doves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They follow the law of the universe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each thing must create its kind,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they speed o&apos;er the track to bring you back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever went out from your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts are truly things, for the reason that every material thing begins in the form of thought-energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven major positive emotions, and seven major negative emotions. The negatives &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt; inject themselves into the thought impulses, which insure passage into the subconscious mind. The positives must be injected, through the principle of auto-suggestion, into the thought impulses which an individual wishes to pass on to his subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven major positive emotions are &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE, FAITH, LOVE, SEX, ENTHUSIASM, ROMANCE&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;HOPE&lt;/strong&gt;. The seven major negative emotions to be avoided are &lt;strong&gt;FEAR, JEALOUSY, HATRED, REVENGE, GREED, SUPERSTITION&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;ANGER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive and negative emotions cannot occupy the mind at the same time. One or the other must dominate, it&apos;s your responsibility to make sure that positive emotions constitute the dominating influence of your mind. Form the habit of applying and using the positive emotions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one&apos;s prayers into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognize, presents the message, and brings back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the object of the prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is the only known agency which will give your thoughts a spiritual nature. &lt;strong&gt;FAITH&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;FEAR&lt;/strong&gt; make poor bedfellows. &lt;em&gt;Where one is found, the other cannot exist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE BRAIN - A BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING STATION FOR THOUGHT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by the radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of picking up vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains. The Creative Imagination is the &quot;receiving set&quot; of the brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. it is the agency of communication between one&apos;s conscious, or reasoning mind, and the four sources from which one may receive thought stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up and carried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy travelling at an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has been modified or &quot;stepped up&quot; by any of the major emotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than ordinary thought, and it is this type of thought which passes from one brain to another, through the broadcasting machinery of the human brain. The brain which has been stimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid rate than it does when that emotion is quiescent or absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subconscious mind is the &quot;sending station&quot; of the brain, through which vibrations of thought are broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the &quot;receiving set,&quot; through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GREATEST FORCES ARE &quot;INTANGIBLE&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; Through the ages which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and has limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh, and measure. We shall learn, as we pass through this age, that the &quot;other self&quot; is more powerful than the physical self we see when we look into a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things men cannot perceive through any of their five senses, and when we hear them, it should remind us that &lt;em&gt;all of us are controlled by forces which are unseen and intangible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE SIXTH SENSE - THE DOOR TO THE TEMPLE OF WISDOM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;thirteenth&quot; principle is known as the &lt;strong&gt;SIXTH SENSE&lt;/strong&gt;, through which Infinite Intelligence may, and will communicate voluntarily, without any effort from, or demands by, the individual. The &lt;strong&gt;SIXTH SENSE&lt;/strong&gt; is that portion of the subconscious mind which has been referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the &quot;receiving set&quot; through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind. The &quot;flashes&quot; are sometimes called &quot;hunches&quot; or &quot;inspirations.&quot; The sixth sense probably is the medium of contact between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence, and for this reason, &lt;em&gt;it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All men have become what they are, because of their &lt;strong&gt;DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND DESIRES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth sense is nothing something that one can take off and put on at will. Ability to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other principles outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable knowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty or pass fifty, for the reason that the spiritual forces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become usable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point of all achievement is &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;. The finishing point is that brand of &lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE&lt;/strong&gt; which leads to understanding - understanding of self, understanding of others, understanding of the laws of Nature, recognition and understanding of &lt;strong&gt;HAPPINESS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MASTERY OF FEAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here will be found a full description of the six fears which are the cause of all discouragement, timidity, procrastination, indifference, indecision, and the lack of ambition, self-reliance, initiative, self-control, and enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HOW TO OUTWIT THE SIX GHOSTS OF FEAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with study, analysis, and understanding of three enemies which you shall have to clear out. They are &lt;strong&gt;INDECISION, DOUBT&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;FEAR!&lt;/strong&gt; The Sixth Sense will never function while these three negatives, or any of them remain in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDECISION&lt;/strong&gt; is the seedling of &lt;strong&gt;FEAR!&lt;/strong&gt; Indecision crystalizes into &lt;strong&gt;DOUBT&lt;/strong&gt;, the two blend and become &lt;strong&gt;FEAR!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six basic fears they are &lt;strong&gt;POVERTY, CRITICISM, ILL HEALTH, LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE, OLD AGE,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fears are nothing more than states of mind.&lt;/em&gt; Fears paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of imagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages initiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out enthusiasm, and makes self-control an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN&apos;S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every human being has the ability to completely control his own mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious truth that we live in a world of over-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing between us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to acknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life more than mediocrity and poverty. Only a courageous analysis will disclose the presence of this universal enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire world is made up of only two things, &lt;strong&gt;ENERGY&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MATTER&lt;/strong&gt;. In elementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy can be created nor destroyed, and both can be transformed. Life is energy, like other forms of energy, may be passed through various processes of transition, or change, but it cannot be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through indecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching a decision to accept death as a inescapable event. Whip the fear of poverty by reaching a decision to get along with whatever wealth you can accumulate &lt;strong&gt;WITHOUT WORRY&lt;/strong&gt;. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of criticism by reaching a decision &lt;strong&gt;NOT TO WORRY&lt;/strong&gt; about what other people think, do, or say. Eliminate the fear of old age by reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a great blessing which carries with it wisdom, self-control, and understanding not known to youth. Acquit yourself of the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms. Master the fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love, if that is necessary. Kill the habit of worry, in all its form, by reaching a general, blanket decision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price of worry. With this decision will come poise, peace of mind, and calmness of thought which will bring happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man whose mind is filled with fear not only destroys his own chances of intelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of all who come into contact with him, and destroys, also their chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be successful, you must find peace of mind, acquire the material needs of life, and above all, attain &lt;strong&gt;HAPPINESS&lt;/strong&gt;. All of these evidences of success begin in the form of thought impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the master of your own earthly destiny just as surely as you have the power to control your own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which people suffer. &lt;strong&gt;IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL THAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS.&lt;/strong&gt; For want of a better name, let us call this evil &lt;strong&gt;SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES&lt;/strong&gt;. Men who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this evil! Its weapon is intangible, because it consists of merely a &lt;strong&gt;STATE OF MIND&lt;/strong&gt;. To protect yourself against negative influences, whether of your own making, or the result of the activities of negative people around you, recognize that you have a &lt;strong&gt;WILL-POWER&lt;/strong&gt;, and put it into constant use, until it builds a will of immunity against negative influences in your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberately seek the company of people who influence you to &lt;strong&gt;THINK AND ACT FOR YOURSELF&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without doubt, the most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people.&lt;/em&gt; This weakness is all the more damaging, because most people do not recognize that they are cursed by it, and many who acknowledge it, neglect or refuse to correct the evil until it becomes an uncontrollable part of their daily habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;ABSOLUTE CONTROL&lt;/strong&gt; over but one thing, and that is your thoughts. Man&apos;s Divine nature which you may control your own destiny. &lt;em&gt;Your mind is your spiritual estate!&lt;/em&gt;, protect and use it with care. Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either control your mind or it controls you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They know &lt;em&gt;all the reasons for failure&lt;/em&gt;, and have what they believe to be air-tight alibis to explain away their own lack of achievement. I had the courage to see myself as I really am, I would &lt;em&gt;find out what is wrong with me, and correct it,&lt;/em&gt; then I might have a chance to profit by my mistakes and learn something from the experience of others, for I know that is something &lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt; with me, or I would now be where I &lt;em&gt;WOULD HAVE BEEN IF&lt;/em&gt; I had spent more time analyzing my weaknesses, and less time building alibis to cover them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first and best victory is to conquer self. To be conquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life is a checkerboard, and the player opposite you is &lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt;. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move promptly, your men will be wiped off the board by &lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt;. You are playing against a partner who will not tolerate &lt;strong&gt;INDECISION&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of creating, &lt;em&gt;in your own mind&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;BURNING DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; for a definite form of riches. There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you do not use it. The price is &lt;strong&gt;FAILURE&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a reward of stupendous proportions if you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who &lt;em&gt;conquer self and force Life to pay whatever is asked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SELF-ANALYSIS TEST QUESTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you complain often of &quot;feeling bad,&quot; and if so, what is the cause?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you find fault with other people at the slightest provocation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you frequently make mistakes in your work, and if so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you sarcastic and offensive in your conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you deliberately avoid the association of anyone, and if so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you suffer frequently with indigestion? If so, what is the cause?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does life seem futile and the future hopeless to you? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you like your occupation? If not, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you often feel self-pity, and if so why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you envious of those who excel you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To which do you devote most time, thinking of SUCCESS, or of FAILURE?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you gaining or losing self-confidence as you grow older?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you learn something of value from all mistakes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you permitting some relative or acquaintance to worry you? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you sometimes &quot;in the clouds&quot; and at other times in the depths of despondency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has the most inspiring influence upon you? What is the cause?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you tolerate negative or discouraging influences which you can avoid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you careless of your personal appearance? If so, when and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you learned how to &quot;drown your troubles&quot; by being too busy to be annoyed by them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you call yourself a &quot;spineless weakling&quot; if you permitted others to do your thinking for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you neglect internal bathing until auto-intoxication makes you ill-tempered and irritable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many preventable disturbances annoy you, and why do you tolerate them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you resort to liquor, narcotics, or cigarettes to &quot;quiet your nerves&quot;? If so, why do you not try will-power instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does anyone &quot;nag&quot; you, and if so, for what reason?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a DEFINITE MAJOR PURPOSE, and if so, what is it, and what plan have you for achieving it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you suffer from any of the Six Basic Fears? If so, which ones?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you a method by which you can shield yourself against the negative influence of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you make deliberate use of auto-suggestion to make your mind positive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which do you value most, your material possessions, or your privilege of controlling your own thoughts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you easily influenced by others, against your own judgment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has today added anything of value to your stock of knowledge or state of mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you face squarely the circumstances which make you unhappy, or sidestep the responsibility?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you analyze all mistakes and failures and try to profit by them or, do you take the attitude that this is not your duty?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you name three of your most damaging weaknesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you doing to correct them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you encourage other people to bring their worries to you for sympathy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you choose, from your daily experiences, lessons or influences which aid in your personal advancement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your presence have a negative influence on other people as a rule?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What habits of other people annoy you most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you form your own opinions or permit yourself to be influenced by other people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you learned how to create a mental state of mind with which you can shield yourself against all discouraging influences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your occupation inspire you with faith and hope?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you conscious of possessing spiritual forces of sufficient power to enable you to keep your mind free from all forms of FEAR?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your religion help you to keep your own mind positive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel it your duty to share other people&apos;s worries? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe that &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; what have you learned about yourself by studying the friends whom you attract?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What connection, if any, do you see between the people with whom you associate most closely, and any unhappiness you may experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could it be possible that some person whom you consider to be a friend is, in reality, your worst enemy, because of his negative influence on your mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By what rules do you judge who is helpful and who is damaging to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are your intimate associates mentally superior or inferior to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time out of every 24 hours do you devote to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. your occupation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;play and relaxation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquiring useful knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plain waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who among your acquaintances,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. encourages you most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. cautions you most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. discourages you most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d. help you most in other ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your greatest worry? Why do you tolerate it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When others offer you free, unsolicited advice, do you accept it without question, or analyze their motive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, above all else, do you most DESIRE? Do you intend to acquire it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you willing to subordinate all other desires for this one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time daily do you devote to acquiring it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you change your mind often? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you usually finish everything you begin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you easily impressed by other people&apos;s business or professional titles, college degrees, or wealth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you easily influenced by what other people think or say of you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you cater to people because of their social or financial status?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whom do you believe to be the greatest person living?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what respect is this person superior to yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time have you devoted to studying and answering these questions? At least one day is necessary for the analysis and the answering of the entire list.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write new code only if an automated test has failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The TDD Mantra&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red - Write a little test that doesn&apos;t work, and perhaps doesn&apos;t even compile at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green - Make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor - Eliminate all of the duplication created in merely getting the test to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Three Techniques for Quickly Getting To Green&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Obvious Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triangulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first option is to &lt;strong&gt;fake it&lt;/strong&gt; which means to return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code. For &lt;strong&gt;obvious implementation&lt;/strong&gt; means to type in the real implementation. Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;triangulation&lt;/strong&gt; is used to get the code to compile quickly with a stub implementation and make the test work by typing in what seemed to be the right code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3A Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange - Create some objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act - Stimulate them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assert - Check the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;TDD Patterns&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is a very important discipline in the software industry. Having test suites gives developers more confidence in making changes to the code base. This will reduce stress knowing that the changes made will not break the code base and reduces the number of errors. When writing or designing a test make sure the tests are independent from each other by decoupling them. By writing isolated tests, we can achieve high cohesion. Be sure to make a test list, write a list of all the tests you know you will have to write. Remember to test first, when we test first, we reduce the stress, which makes us more likely to test. Lastly, use data that makes the test easy to read and follow, you are writing tests for a reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Testing Patterns&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing a test that is too big, try writing a smaller test case that represents the broken part of the bigger test case. When testing an object that relies on an expensive or complicated resource, create a mock object of the resource that answers constants. You may leave the last test broken when taking a break, this will allow you to think about what you wrote and help you continue finishing the test. Always make sure that all of the tests are running before you check in your code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apprenticeship Patterns - Guidance For The Aspiring Software Craftsman]]></title><description><![CDATA[To become a software craftsman you must value your craft, practicing disciplines that will help you create clean code.

It&apos;s about continuous improvement and learning, a belief that you can be better and everything can be improved if you&apos;re prepared to work at it, &quot;effort is what makes you smart and talented&quot;. Always adapting and changing based on the feedback you get from the world around you. Willingness to teach and share your knowledge to others who are willing to learn. We believe that we are all on the same journey and that the change we seek is in ourselves, not the world. This means to walk The Long Road, a lifelong journey of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book talks about software craftsman&apos;s paths to mastering their craft. Many similar paths taken by craftsman, the book calls this apprenticeship pattern. It&apos;s about drawing your own map, a map that will help guide you towards mastery. It&apos;s our responsibility to learn to grow ourselves. This focus on yourself and your need to grow is the essence of what it means to be an apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Emptying the Cup&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be times when we think we know everything and are experts at a particular topic or field, a metaphor for this will be a cup that is full. To become an apprentice you must first empty your cup so that you can fill it with new skills. The best way to learn these new skills is by being in the same room with people who are trying to achieve some goal using the skills you wish to learn. Be the worst on your team will help you learn quicker, think about the sink or swim strategy. Emptying your cup means to be willing to learn new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Walking the Long Road&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a lifelong journey, as soon as a person stops practicing, her/his mastery fades. Your goal is to measure your abilities and find ways to be better than you were yesterday. Software development is composed of two primary activities: learning and communication. Learning is a perpetual activity for those on the The Long Road to mastery. Remember that you are walking The Long Road, and this journey is not a sprint. People who walk the Long Road are people moving at a sustainable pace for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Accurate Self-Assessment&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this journey is finding mentors with skills you want to acquire. These kindred spirits will help guide you by sharing their knowledge and skills. There are many kindred spirits around the world and in your community that you can reach out to. Continue to evaluate your current skills with skills you want to acquire and check your road map to see if you&apos;re on track. Take the time to get the most out of your apprenticeship, and understand that whether you have been programming for three months or five years, you are still very much a beginner when it comes to software craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Perpetual Learning&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core theme of an apprenticeship is learning and the dominant trait of a successful apprentice is a demonstration of her/his learning abilities. Like everything in life you must practice to get better. One way to practice is by creating Breakable Toys, failure is often the best way to learn anything. Seek out other people&apos;s code and read it, a good place will be the open source world. Only by reading the code can one truly understand a system. Lastly, it&apos;s important to record what your learned and to share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Construct Your Curriculum&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no assigned reading, it&apos;s up to you to find recommendations and construct your own curriculum. Create your own reading list of books, maintain a list to track the books you plan to read and to remember the books you&apos;ve read. Decide what your next book will be, keep up the momentum after you&apos;ve finished a book. You need to become an active participant in your ongoing self-education and construct your curriculum. Learning to enjoy the learning process itself will serve you well in the ever-changing technology landscape that keeps us perpetually on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Understanding The 4 Rules Of Simple Design]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rather than planning for change points, we build systems, by applying simple design principles, that can change easily at ANY point. 4 Rules…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/understanding-the-four-rules-of-simple-design/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/understanding-the-four-rules-of-simple-design/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rather than planning for change points, we build systems, by applying simple design principles, that can change easily at ANY point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;4 Rules of Simple Design&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests Pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expresses Intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Duplication DRY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Test Names Should Influence Object&apos;s API&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of naming, and how it relates to the intent of your code can seen when looking at the symmetry between test names and the test code. When we write our tests, we should be spending time on our test names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_a_new_world_is_empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_true world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_a_cell_can_be_added_to_the_world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;set_living_at&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_true world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;alive_at&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_after_adding_a_cell_the_world_is_not_empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;set_living_at&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_false world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the symmetry between a good test name and the code
under tests is a subtle design technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Duplication of Knowledge about Topology&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to detect knowledge duplication is to ask what happens if we want to change something. What effort is required? How many places will we need to look at and change? A good example from the Conway&apos;s Game of Life is to extract the data that represents the location into its own class. This way if you change from two dimensions to three dimensions, you just have to change the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;set_living_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alive_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LivingCell&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:location&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DeadCell&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:location&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the code more adaptable and readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Behavoir Attractors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have a new method, a new behavoir, an important question is &quot;where do we put it?&quot; What type does this belong to? Imageine we find ourselves in need of asking for the neighbor locations for a given x, y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;neighbors_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# calculate the coordinates of neighbors&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can add this method in several places, but the most logical place is in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt; class. This class focus on the topology, our behavior is asking for what locations constitute the neighborhood around a given location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By aggressively eliminating knowledge duplication through reification, we often find that we have built classes that naturally accept new behaviors that arise. They not only accept, but attract them; by the time we are looking to implement a new behavior, there is already a type that is an obvious place to put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Testing State vs Testing Behavoir&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate way to develop a system is to focus on the behavoir rather than the state of the objects. Think about what behaviors you expect and have our tests center around those. Building our system in a behavior-focused way is about only building the things that are absolutely needed and only at the time they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an example from the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_a_new_world_is_empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_true &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# this behavior test will help create other tests (above test)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_an_empty_world_stays_empty_after_a_tick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    next_world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tick
    assert_true next_world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Don&apos;t Have Tests Depend on Previous Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking above at the test case test&lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;empty&lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;stays&lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt;after&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;tick, the test name indicates we are starting with an empty world, but the test code does not specify this explicitly. There is an assumption here that new worlds are empty, what if we don&apos;t start with an empty world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of letting the test name influence the test code and use that to make the test code a bit more explicit, let&apos;s explicitly ask for an empty world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_an_empty_world_stays_empty_after_a_tick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; World&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty
      next_world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tick
    assert_true next_world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside world can’t use new to instantiate an object with an expectation of a specific state. Instead, there must be an explicitly named builder method on the class to create an object in a specific, valid state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Breaking Abstraction Level&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a earlier example, we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_world_is_not_empty_after_adding_a_cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; World&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty
    world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;set_living_at&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_false world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that we are testing for a empty world then adding a cell into the empty world. However, looking at the test code, we can see details about the topology: the 1,1. In this case, the test code is implying that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt; method is somehow dependent on the coordinates, themselves. To improve this, we hide the details of the topology from the world object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_world_is_not_empty_after_adding_a_cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    world &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; World&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty
    world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;set_living_at&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;random&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_false world&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;empty&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By isolating ourselves from changes to the topology, the internals of the Location, we help ensure that this test won’t break if we change something about the underlying coordinate system. You can also use test double.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Naive Duplication&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:alive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# true | false&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alive_in_next_generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; alive
        number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3&apos;s are not the same. In our alive case, the 3 is more closely linked to the 2 in the concept of a “stable neighborhood,” while in the dead case, it is linked to something like a “genetically fertile neighborhood.” A good technique is to refactor the conditions into methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alive_in_next_generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; alive
        stable_neighborhood&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        genetically_fertile_neighborhood&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Procedural Polymorphism&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code above, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/code&gt; condition isn&apos;t a very good choice. Resolving this requires us to talk a bit about polymorphism in general. Polymorphism is about being able to call a method/send a message to an object and have more than one possible behavior. A seemingly quick solution would be to make it something like state and raise it to types: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;LivingCell&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DeadCell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LivingCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stays_alive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      neighbor_count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; neighbor_count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DeadCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;comes_to_life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      neighbor_count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great benefit is that we can add a new state, by adding a new class. We &lt;em&gt;extend&lt;/em&gt; our system, rather than modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ZombieCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alive_in_next_generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# new, possibly more complex rules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Making Assumption About Usage&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s look at the Cell classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LivingCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stays_alive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;number_of_neighbors&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DeadCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;comes_to_life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;number_of_neighbors&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice we talking about classes here. A class tend to encapsulate and provide behavoir around state. Methods on them are generally involved in working with that state. In this state the methods are not accessing internal state. Why don’t we reify the idea of a rule? One of the key parts of being easier to change i.e. a better design is being able to more easily find where the changes need to occur; this is what good naming contributes to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LivingCellRules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stays_alive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;number_of_neighbors&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DeadCellRules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;comes_to_life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;number_of_neighbors&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      number_of_neighbors &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Unwrapping an Object&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example, imagine we have the following two location objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  location1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  location2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; location1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;equals&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;location2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Do something interesting&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;other_location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; other_location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; other_location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;equals?&lt;/code&gt; method doesn’t conform to our constraint: it is asking other_location to return its x and y. This isn’t allowed. A technique that call unwrapping, follows alternate form of equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/span&gt;
    attr_reader &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;other_location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      other_location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;equals_coordinate&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;equals_coordinate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;other_x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; other_y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; other_x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; other_y
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new form of equals only allows the object access to it&apos;s own states. The section goes deeper into a constraints in coderetreat is writing your code with “no return values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Inverted Composition as a Replacement for Inheritance&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheritance is often used as way of creating “reuse” rather than eliminating duplication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Clean Coder - A Code Of Conduct For Professional Programmers]]></title><description><![CDATA[As an engineer, you have a depth of knowledge about your systems and projects that no managers can possibly have.

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren&apos;t responsible for the imperfections. As an aspiring professional, the first thing you must practice is apologizing. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true professional knows that delivering function at the expense of structure is a fool&apos;s errand. It is the structure of your code that allow it to be flexible. If you compromise the structure, you compromise the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals spend time caring for their profession. Professionals practice. True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of every software professional to understand the domain of the solutions they are programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers. The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest. The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own responsibilities as well as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say we will commit to something, and we need to mean it. The real truth is that you, personally, ALWAYS have something that&apos;s under your control, so there is always something you can fully commit to doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember if you don&apos;t tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you&apos;re not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them. However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make &quot;yes&quot; possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional developers allocate their personal time in order to ensure that the time spent at the office is as productive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly measure your progress against your goals and come up with three fact-based end dates: best case, nominal case, and worst case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not agree to work overtime unless 1) you can personally afford it, 2) it is short term, two weeks or less, and 3) your boss has a fallback plan in case the overtime effort fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Three Laws of Test Driven Development TDD&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most powerful benefits of TDD. When you have a suite of tests that you trust, then you lose all fear of making changes. When programmers lost the fear of cleaning, they clean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD is the professional option, it is a discipline that enhances certainty, courage, defect reduction, documentation, and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional programmers practice on their own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business people want to know exactly what they are going to get before they authorize a project. Developers want to know exactly what they are supposed to deliver before they estimate the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of professional developers and stakeholders to make sure that all ambiguity is removed from the requirement. Acceptance test are tests written by a collaboration of the stakeholders and the programmers in order to define when a requirement is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance test should always be automated. Professionals’ developers take responsibility for their part in ensuring that acceptance test are automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional developers have a single definition of done: Done means done. Done means all code written, all tests pass, QA and the stakeholder have accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional evaluate the priority of each task, disregarding their personal fears and desires, and execute those tasks in priority order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software professionals are diligent in the management of their time and their focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals draw a clear distinction between estimates and commitments. They do not commit unless they know for certain they will succeed. They are careful not to make any implied commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals will always help the business find a way to achieve its goals. But professionals do not necessarily accept commitments made by the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the going gets tough, trust your disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A craftsman is someone who works quickly, but without rushing, who provides reasonable estimates and meet commitments. A craftsman knows when to say no, but tries hard to say yes. Craftsmanship is a meme that contains value, disciplines, techniques, attitudes, and answer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JavaScript - The Good Parts]]></title><description><![CDATA[The very good ideas include functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation.

The bad ideas include a programming model based on global variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The values produced by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; are &apos;number&apos;, &apos;string&apos;, &apos;boolean&apos;, &apos;undefined&apos;,
&apos;function&apos;, and &apos;object&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator produces the value of its first operand if the first operand is falsy. Otherwise, it produces the value of the second operand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator produces the value of its first operand if the first operand is truthy. Otherwise, it produces the value of the second operand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;list of &lt;em&gt;falsy&lt;/em&gt; values:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;null&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undefined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The empty string &apos;&apos;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number NaN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; All other values are truthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Objects&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple types of JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans true and false, null, and undefined. All other values are objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quotes around a property’s name in an object literal are optional if the name would be a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word. Values can be retrieved from an object by wrapping a string expression in a [ ] suffix. If the string expression is a constant, and if it is a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word, then the . notation can be used instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; object &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;first-name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Jordan&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;last_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Wu&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;first-name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns Jordan&lt;/span&gt;
object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;last_name &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns Wu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit properties. If we try to retrieve a property value from an object, and if the object lacks the property name, then JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the prototype object. And if that object is lacking the property, then it goes to its prototype, and so on until the process finally bottoms out with Object.prototype. Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;object.hasOwnProperty(variable)&lt;/code&gt; to determine whether the property name is truly a member of the object or was found instead on the prototype chain and using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; to exclude functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects produced from object literals are linked to Object.prototype. Function objects are linked to Function.prototype which is itself linked to Object.prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Functions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects produced from object literals are linked to Object.prototype. Function objects are linked to Function.prototype which is itself linked to Object.prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions can be defined inside of other functions. An inner function of course has access to its parameters and variables. An inner function also enjoys access to the parameters and variables of the functions it is nested within. The function object created by a function literal contains a link to that outer context. This is called &lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the declared parameters, every function receives two additional parameters: &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt;. There is no runtime error when the number of arguments and the number of parameters do not match. If there are too many argument values, the extra argument values will be ignored. If there are too few argument values, the undefined value will be substituted for the missing values. There is no type checking on the argument values: any type of value can be passed to any parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Method Invocation Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is when a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it a method. When a method is invoked, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is bound to that object. A method can use &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; to access the object so that it can retrieve values from the object or modify the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Function Invocation Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is when a function is not the property of an object, then it is invoked as a function. When a function is invoked with this pattern, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is bound to the global object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a prototypal inheritance language. &lt;strong&gt;The Constructor Invocation Pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is when a function is invoked with the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; prefix, then a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function’s prototype member, and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be bound to that new object. Functions that are intended to be used with the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; prefix are called constructors. By convention, they are kept in variables with a capitalized name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Apply Invocation Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;, Because JavaScript is a functional object-oriented language, functions can have methods. The &lt;em&gt;apply&lt;/em&gt; method lets us construct an array of arguments to use to invoke a function. It also lets us choose the value of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt; statement can be used to cause the function to return early. When &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt; is executed, the function returns immediately without executing the remaining statements. A function always returns a value. If the return value is not specified, then &lt;em&gt;undefined&lt;/em&gt; is returned. If the function was invoked with the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; prefix and the &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt; value is not an object, then &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; the new object is returned instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;throw&lt;/em&gt; statement interrupts execution of the function. It should be given an exception object containing a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; property that identifies the type of the exception, and a descriptive &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript allows the basic types of the language to be &lt;em&gt;augmented&lt;/em&gt;, that adding a method to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Object.prototype&lt;/code&gt; makes that method available to all objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scope&lt;/em&gt; in a programming language controls the visibility and lifetimes of variables and parameters. JavaScript does have function scope. That means that the parameters and variables defined in a function are not visible outside of the function, and that a variable defined anywhere within a function is visible everywhere within the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use functions and closure to make modules. A module is a function or object that presents an interface but that hides its state and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have those methods return &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; instead of undefined, we can enable cascades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions can use objects to remember the results of previous operations, making it possible to avoid unnecessary work. This optimization is called &lt;em&gt;memoization&lt;/em&gt;. JavaScript’s objects and arrays are very convenient for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;inheritance&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Object Specifiers&lt;/strong&gt; when a constructor is given a very large number of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototypal inheritance is conceptually simpler than classical inheritance: a new object can inherit the properties of an old object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weakness of the inheritance patterns we have seen so far is that we get no privacy. All properties of an object are visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Arrays&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript provides an object that has some array-like characteristics. An
array literal is a pair of square brackets surrounding zero or more values separated by commas. An array literal can appear anywhere an expression can appear. The first value will get the property name &apos;0&apos;, the second value will get the property name &apos;1&apos;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common error in JavaScript programs is to use an object when an array is required or an array when an object is required. The rule is simple: when the property names are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript does not have a good mechanism for distinguishing between arrays and objects. We can work around that deficiency by defining our own is_array function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;is_array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;object&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;number&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;splice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;function&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;propertyIsEnumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;length&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript provides a set of methods for acting on arrays. The methods are functions stored in Array.prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Regular Expression&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of JavaScript’s features were borrowed from other languages. The syntax came from Java, functions came from Scheme, and prototypal inheritance came from Self. JavaScript’s Regular Expression feature was borrowed from Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions are used with methods to search, replace, and extract information from strings. The methods that work with regular expressions are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;regexp.exec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;regexp.test&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;string.match&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;string.replace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;string.search&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;string.split&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Methods&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript includes a small set of standard methods that are available on the standard types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don't Make Me Think - Revisited]]></title><description><![CDATA[The worlds has changed at a rapid rate after the invention of transistors, a device that can hold one of two states.

This technology has brought many changes to industries over the years. One of the biggest trends involves the web, many advancements has made the web a place for business. Investing in a website will drastically increase the value of any company, this is the best medium where customers purchase products and services. The book talks about creating better user experience UX by focusing on usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX is about creating better experience for the users. The average web users are all unique, you can&apos;t make any assumptions. Business these days are heavily reliant on interaction over the web where the users are the customers. To keep the customers happy we must focus on usability, how easy it is for users to use your website without question marks. To accomplish this task we can use usability testing that focus on a set of attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Usability Attributes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful&lt;/strong&gt;: Does it do something people need done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learnable&lt;/strong&gt;: Can people figure out how to use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memorable&lt;/strong&gt;: Do they have to relearn it each time they use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective&lt;/strong&gt;: Does it get the job done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient&lt;/strong&gt;: Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirable&lt;/strong&gt;: Do people want it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delightful&lt;/strong&gt;: Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is that a person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it&apos;s worth. The answer is &quot;Don&apos;t make me think!” Users who goes on your website has a task to accomplish within a time constraint, they want to be able to navigate through the site without wondering if they are doing it right. This means we have to create a website that people can &quot;get it&quot; without too much thinking. The most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way to enhance usability is by doing a &lt;strong&gt;usability testing&lt;/strong&gt;, are about watching one person at a time try to use something to do typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse or frustrate them. If you want to know whether something is easy enough to use, watch some people while they try to use it and note where they run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t figure out how things work. We muddle through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some take away from the books are most of the time people glance at each page and click and navigate to things that attracts them. Users scans the page for keywords they are looking for, they are on a mission to do a task and as the web designers and developers our goal is to make it easy. Make the choices mindless, users don&apos;t have to think about how to get to a specific page or accomplish a task. There&apos;s many things you can do like having a good navbar, obvious names for links/buttons, breadcrumbs, following existing conventions, and reducing noise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Passionate Programmer - Creating A Remarkable Career In Software Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[This book made me reflected on my life.

What career am I striving for? Why do I want to become a software engineer? What industry and technologies should I specialize in? We must focus on what career we want to live, most of our time will be spent working for a company or a customer. Our skills and value are our product and we are a business, we are hired to add value to a company. Business is all about making value and satisfying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my life I&apos;m lost, I have no idea what my future looks like and what type of life I want to live. I remember attending college, I was finishing my general studies, and I started thinking about what to major in. Having no idea of what I like and what I am passionate about, I spent months thinking about it. I would lay on my bed thinking about this world I live in instead of going to class. My grade started to take effect of my lost concentration during this time period. This was me, a student with no ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day, I had a dream. In this dream I was holding a piece of paper that had the words &quot;firefighter or engineer&quot;. When I woke up, I remember seeing that paper somewhere in my life. After spending time pondering about when and where, I realized it was during a time when I did a career path survey in junior high school. I got those choices because I want to make this world a better place. I decided to major in electrical engineering, it seem interesting and fun. This was the turning point in my life, I was twenty years old and had a goal of graduating in electrical engineering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I realized was that I was behind! I spent almost two years in college doing general studies. I looked at the pre-engineering course at Salt Lake Community College and signed up for eighteen credit hours. I was nervous and afraid, the self-doubt of not being smart enough to graduate in electrical engineering was hard to overcome. I&apos;m a normal student that attend class, takes notes, procrastinate, do homework, and study. This time I had a goal and a different mindset, I realized I was behind and had to work hard to catch up, this motivated me to take eighteen credits hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I learned how to learn by reading textbooks and working on homework assignments. This skill is important, being able to teach yourself, adds value to your personal brand. As we go through school, we always relied on teachers to teach us skills. I wasn&apos;t fully aware of this until one day I told my niece I could teach her, she responded with I wasn&apos;t her teacher. The best teacher is yourself, you have to believe that you can learn skills on your own. Textbooks and other resources became my source of knowledge. There were times when I didn&apos;t attend class because I was confident in learning it on my own. I would continue taking eighteen credit every semester until I graduate in May 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other turning point in my life was when I first learned about programming in my early twenties. I knew nothing! I had no idea what a Boolean was! I learn everything from reading a textbook, I could create simple programs that solves simple problems. My focus wasn&apos;t on becoming a programmer at the time, it was focus on becoming an electrical engineer. It wasn&apos;t until my senior year in college when my interest in computer science grew. I started to explore computer science by taking courses on Object Oriented Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms, and Computer Organization. After graduating college, my focus was to become a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I want to become a software engineer? I want to be a lifetime learner. Everything about software engineer seem fun and exciting, crafting beautiful software for customers, these software will add value to people&apos;s lives. The software industry is constantly changing, it&apos;s an industry that I won&apos;t be bored in. I have been learning about programming and it&apos;s something I&apos;m passionate about, so I decided to invest in becoming a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your life is primary consumed by your work, then loving your work is one of the most important keys to loving your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at software engineer jobs posting today, most of them are for web development. The current trends are creating responsive web applications, everyone has a cellphone that has access to the web. It&apos;s easy to open up a browser and go to your favorite website. There&apos;s a lot of value in web development, this is the best medium for business to get customers. One important aspect of development is selecting the technologies for building them. Picking the technologies to invest in will impact your product, which is your skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of becoming a software engineer is to pick a business domain. It&apos;s important to choose an industry or company, you want to learn more than just coding, learn about the industry and company you work in. This will give you more value to the company and industry. The web development industry seem like a great place to invest my skills in, I enjoy learning about front-end and back-end of web applications. What I like most about this industry is the technologies are always changing and working with other teammates that shares the same passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book talked about thinking like a winner, winners only think about winning. With this mindset we are able to set goals and will be determined to achieve them. Business wants to hire people who finish things! Keep practicing and stretch your limits! Practicing means to do something we haven&apos;t done before, if your code doesn&apos;t look perfect this means you doing it right, if your code is perfect this means you’re not stretching your limits. Try something new! Like exploring existing code in open source project, this allows you to learn from reading other professional&apos;s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easy to focus on our long-term goals, but remember to set short-term goals and focus on the present. You have control over your present self, think about what you can change and improve each day that will help the future you reach that long-term goal. Remember winners takes calculated risk. When setting your career goals, remind yourself that your job title isn&apos;t your product. The company&apos;s position doesn&apos;t define your skills set. It&apos;s important to never be comfortable at your current position. Continue adding values to your product, there&apos;s no such thing as job security in this ever changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market yourself! Let people know you exist and that you can solve problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing your brand is important! Your brand is your name, never tarnish your brand! Be a doer whenever you say you would do something, this will give you credibility by doing the task on time. Let people judge you based on your abilities, your goodness at your company is subjective, always measured based on someone else&apos;s perception of you. Remember that managers and customers are afraid of you because you&apos;re smart. Your technical writing skills are the most important skill that employers look at, you are what you can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start planning your goals, planning is the first step to executing your goals, make a to-do list every day, once you get good start plan weekly then work your way up to monthly. The secret is to focus on whatever it is you’re trying to improve better than it was yesterday. Use incremental changes to get you closer each day towards your goals. To have a remarkable life you must invest in your product and to plan it!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code Complete Second Editon - A Practical Handbook Of Software Construction]]></title><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code-Tuning Strategies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Strategic performance issues: what performance is, how important it is, and the general approach to achieving it.

Code tuning is one way of improving a program&apos;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are more interested in tangible program characteristics than they are in code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code tuning is the practice of modifying correct code in ways that make it run more efficiently. &quot;Tuning&quot; refers to small-scale changes that affect a single class, a single routine, or, more commonly, a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a high-quality design. Make the program right. Make it modular and easily modifiable so that it&apos;s easy to work on later. When it&apos;s complete and correct, check the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When shopping for a compiler, compare the performance of each compiler on your program. Each compiler has different strengths and weaknesses, and some will be better suited to your program than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always have to profile the program to know with any confidence which parts are slow and fat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code-Tuning Techniques]]></title><description><![CDATA[Performance usually refers to both speed and size, but size reductions tend to come more from redesigning classes and data than from tuning…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/code-tuning-techniques/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/code-tuning-techniques/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Performance usually refers to both speed and size, but size reductions tend to come more from redesigning classes and data than from tuning code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages provide a form of expression evaluation known as &quot;short-circuit evaluation,&quot; which means that the compiler generates code that automatically stops testing as soon as it knows the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrange test so that the one that&apos;s fastest and most likely to be true is performed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some circumstances, a table lookup might be quicker than traversing a complicated chain of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a program uses lazy evaluation, it avoids doing any work until the work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching refers to making a decision inside a loop every time it&apos;s executed. If the decision doesn&apos;t change while the loop is executing, you can unswitch the loop by making the decision outside the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamming, or &quot;fusion&quot; is the result of combining two loops that operate no the same set of elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the loop is a search loop, one way to simplify the test is to use a sentinel value, a value that you put just past the end of the search range and that&apos;s guaranteed to terminate the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to improving the loop is that the outer loop executes much more often than the inner loops, put the busiest loop on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing strength means replacing an expensive operation such as multiplication with a cheaper operation such as addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in data types can be a powerful aid in reducing program size and improving execution speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used named constants and literals that are the same type as the variables they&apos;re assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful tools in code tuning is a good routine decomposition. Small, well-defined routines saves space because they take the place of doing jobs separately in multiple places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code tuning invariably involves tradeoffs among complexity, readability, simplicity, and maintainability on the one hand and a desire to improve performance on the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Controlling Loops]]></title><description><![CDATA["Loop" is an informal term that refers to any kind of iterative control structure - any structure that causes a program to repeatedly…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/controlling-loops/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/controlling-loops/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Loop&quot; is an informal term that refers to any kind of iterative control structure - any structure that causes a program to repeatedly execute a block of code. Loop are differentiated first by flexibility - whether the loop executes a specific number of times or whether it tests for completion on each iteration, also differentiated by the location of the test for completion. Flexibility and the location of the test determine the kind of loop to choose as a control structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t know ahead of time exactly how many times you&apos;ll want the loop to iterate, use a &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; loop is a good choice when you need a loop that executes a specific number of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of &lt;em&gt;foreach&lt;/em&gt; loop is eliminating loop-housekeeping arithmetic and therefore eliminating any chance of errors in the loop-housekeeping arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient programmers do the work of mental simulations and hand calculations because they know that such measures help them find errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Defensive Programming]]></title><description><![CDATA[In defensive programming, the main idea is that if a routine is passed bad data, it won't be hurt, even if the bad data is another routine's…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/defensive-programming/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/defensive-programming/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In defensive programming, the main idea is that if a routine is passed bad data, it won&apos;t be hurt, even if the bad data is another routine&apos;s fault. Protect yourself from the cold, cruel world of invalid data, events that can &quot;never&quot; happen, and other programmers&apos; mistakes. A good program never puts out garbage, regardless of what it takes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assertion is code that&apos;s used during development - usually a routine or macro - that allows a program to check itself as it runs. They enable programmers to more quickly flush out mismatched interface assumptions, errors that creep in when code is modified, and so on. An assertion usually takes two arguments: a Boolean expression that describes the assumption that&apos;s supposed to be true, and a message to display if it isn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use error-handling code for conditions you expect to occur; use assertions for conditions that should never occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correctness means never returning an inaccurate result; returning non result is better than returning an inaccurate result. Robustness means always trying to do something that will allow the software to keep operating, even if that leads to results that are inaccurate sometimes. Safety-critical applications tend to favor correctness to robustness, while consumer applications tends to favor robustness to correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exception are a specific means by which code can pass along errors or exceptional events to the code that called it. Code that has no sense of the context of an error can return control to other parts of the system that might have a better ability to interpret the error and do something useful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barricades are damage-containment strategy. One way to barricade for defensive programming purposes is to designate certain interfaces as boundaries to &quot;safe&quot; areas. Check data crossing the boundaries of a safe area for validity, and respond sensibly if the data isn&apos;t valid. This can be used at class level, the public methods assume the data is unsafe, and they are responsible for checking the data and sanitizing it. Once the data has been accepted by the class&apos;s public methods, the class&apos;s private methods can assume the data is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of defensive programming is the use of debugging aids, which can be a powerful ally in quickly detecting errors. Be willing to trade speed and resources usage during development in exchange for built-in tools that can make development go more smoothly. Plan to remove debugging aids before production!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Debugging]]></title><description><![CDATA[Debugging is the process of identifying the root cause of an error and correcting it.

A bug in software means that a programmer made a mistake. You don&apos;t need to learn how to fix defects; you need to learn how to avoid them in the first place. If you have a problem with a program you&apos;ve written, it&apos;s your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An error that doesn&apos;t occur predictably is usually an initialization error, a timing issue, or a dangling-pointer problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute force approach to debugging is a technique that might be tedious, arduous, and time consuming but that is guaranteed to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of good programming practices: good formatting, commenting, variable names, routine names, and other elements of programming style help structure the programming background so that likely defects appear as variations and stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programmers who debug most effectively mentally slice away parts of the program that aren&apos;t relevant during debugging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Collaborative Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[In one way or another, all collaborative construction techniques are attempts to formalize the process of showing your work to someone else…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/collaborative-construction/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/collaborative-construction/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, all collaborative construction techniques are attempts to formalize the process of showing your work to someone else for the purpose of flushing out errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Collaborative construction&quot; refers to pair programming, formal inspections, informal technical reviews, and document reading, as well as other techniques in which developers share responsibility for creating code and other work products. This is based on the ideas that developers are blind to some of the trouble spots, and it&apos;s beneficial for developers to have someone else look at their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews are an important mechanism for giving programmers feedback about their code. Programmers who are still we behind the ears need guidance from those who are more knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With collective ownership, all code is owned by the group rather than by individuals and can be accessed and modified by various members of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pair programming, one programmer types in code at the keyboard and the other programmer watches for mistakes and think strategically about whether the code is being written correctly and whether the right code is being written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspection is a specific kind of review that has been shown to be extremely effective in detecting defects and to be relatively economical compared to testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design In Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[The phrase "software design" means the conception, invention, or contrivance of a scheme for turning a specification for computer software…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/design-in-construction/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/design-in-construction/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The phrase &quot;software design&quot; means the conception, invention, or contrivance of a scheme for turning a specification for computer software into operational software. Design is the activity that links requirements to coding and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;wicked&quot; problem as one that could be clearly defined only by solving it, or by solving part of it. This paradox implies that you have to &quot;solve&quot; the problem once in order to clearly define it and then solve it again to create a solution that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good design depends on understanding the importance of managing complexity by dividing the system into subsystems. The more independent the subsystem are, the more you make it safe to focus on one bit of complexity at a time. There&apos;s a list of desirable characteristics of a Design: Minimal complexity, Ease of maintenance, Loose coupling, Extensibility, Reusability, High fan-in, Low-to-medium fan-out, portability, Leanness, and Stratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to decouple subsystem by only allowing &quot;need to know&quot; communication. A program shouldn&apos;t contain any circular relationships in which Class A uses Class B, Class B uses Class C, and Class C uses Class A. Here are the level of Design: level 1: Software System, Level 2: Division into Subsystems or Packages, Level 3: Division into Classes, Level 4: Division into Routines, and Level 5: Internal Routine Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is the ability to engage with a concept while safely ignoring some of its details. From the complexity point of view, the principal benefit of abstraction is that it allows you to ignore irrelevant details. Good programmers create abstractions at many levels of design. A base class are abstractions that allow you to focus on common attributes of a set of derived classes and ignore the details of the specific classes while you&apos;re working on the base class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encapsulation picks up where abstraction leaves off, encapsulation helps to manage complexity by forbidding you to look at the complexity. In designing a software system, you&apos;ll often find objects that are much like other objects, except for a few differences. Defining similarities and differences among such objects is called &quot;inheritance&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Developer Testing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Testing is usually broken into two broad categories: black-box testing and white-box or glass-box testing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is a means of detecting errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debugging is a means of diagnosing and correcting the root causes of errors that have already been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing test cases first will minimize the amount of time between when a defect is inserted into the code and when the defect is detected and removed. Test-first programming is one of the most beneficial software practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Code coverage&quot; testing or &quot;logic coverage&quot; testing are approaches in which you test all the path through a program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of boundary analysis is to write test cases that exercise the boundary conditions, also applies to minimum and maximum allowable values.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fundamental Data Types]]></title><description><![CDATA[The fundamental data types are the basic building blocks for all other data types.

Use the identifiers true and false in boolean expressions rather than using values like 0 and 1. Avoid complicated negative boolean expressions in your program.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;compound statement&quot; or &quot;block&quot; is a collection of statements that are treated as a single statement for purpose of controlling the flow of a program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid deep nesting, few people can understand more than three levels of nested &lt;em&gt;ifs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of structured programming is the simple idea that a program should use only one-in, one-out control constructs. A one-in, one-out control construct is a block of code that has only one place it can start and only one place it can end. A structured program progresses in an orderly, disciplined way, rather than jumping around unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central concept of structured programming are still useful today and apply to consideration in using &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;throw&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;catch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt;, and other topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Programming complexity&quot; is the number of mental objects you have to keep in mind simultaneously in order to understand the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor use of control structures increases complexity; good use decreases it. All control structures depend on the evaluation of boolean expression. Use the identifiers true and false in boolean expressions rather than using values like 0 and 1. Avoid complicated negative boolean expressions in your program. Organize numeric test so that they follow points on a number line.&lt;/p&gt;

Languages that require you to declare data explicitly are, in essence, requiring you to use data more carefully, which is one of their primary advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improper data initialization is one of the most fertile sources of error in computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope, or visibility, refers to the extent to which your variables are known and can be referenced throughout a program. It&apos;s always a good idea to localize references to variables by keeping them close together. A variable&apos;s life begins at the first statement in which it&apos;s referenced; it&apos;s life ends at the last statement in which it&apos;s referenced. A short live time makes your code more readable, fewer lines of code a reader has to keep in mind at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Persistence&quot; is another word for the life span of a piece of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Binding time&quot;: the time at which the variable and its value are bound together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential data consists of clusters of data used together in a certain order. Selective data is a collection in which one of several pieces of data is used at any particular time. Iterative data is the same type of data repeated several times. Your real data can be combination of all three types of data above.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Managing Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quality goals and size of the project both significantly affect how a specific software project should be managed.

&lt;p&gt;If someone on a project is going to define standards, have a respected architect define the standard rather than the manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration management is the practice of identifying project artifacts and handling changes systematically so that a system can maintain its integrity over time. It includes technique for evaluating proposed changes, tracking changes, and keeping copies of the system as it existed at various point in time. Usually called &quot;software configuration management&quot; SCM, focuses on a program&apos;s requirements, source code, documentation, and test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standardized development machine configurations is a disk image created of a standard developer workstation, including all the common developer tools, office applications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backup plan; it&apos;s the idea of backing up your work periodically. Save a copy of everything: source code, compilers, tools, requirements, design, documentation, everything you need to re-create the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing a software project is one of the formidable challenges of the twenty-first century, and estimating the size of a project and effort required to complete it is one of the most challenging aspects of software-project management.
Another level of sophistication is required to develop a group of programs that work together.

The more communication path you have, the more time you spend communicating and the more opportunities are created for communication mistakes. As project size increases, a larger percentage of errors can usually be attributed to mistakes in requirements and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product that&apos;s twice as large is likely to have more than twice as many errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As project size increases, construction becomes a smaller part of the total effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the size of a project, a few techniques are always valuable: disciplined coding practices, design and code inspections by other developers, good tool support, and use of high-level languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more sophisticated kind of program is a software &quot;product,&quot; a program that&apos;s intended for use by people other than the original developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another level of sophistication is required to develop a group of programs that work together. Such group is called a software &quot;system&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[High-Quality Routines]]></title><description><![CDATA[A routine is an individual method or procedure invokable for a single purpose.

The routine is the greatest technique ever invented for saving space and improving performance. The single most important reason to create a routine is to reduce a program&apos;s complexity. One of the strongest mental blocks to creating routines is a reluctance to create a simple routine for a simple purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohesion for routines refers to how closely the operation in a routine are related. The goal is to have each routine do one thing well and not do anything else. A good name for a routine clearly describes everything the routine does. A function is a routine that returns a value; a procedure is a routine that does not.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Integration]]></title><description><![CDATA[The term "integration" refers to the software development activity in which you combine separate software components into a single system…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/integration/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/integration/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;integration&quot; refers to the software development activity in which you combine separate software components into a single system. The order in which you build class or components affects the order in which you can integrate them, you can&apos;t integrate something that hasn&apos;t been built yet. If you construct and integrate software in the wrong order, it&apos;s harder to code, harder to test, and harder to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phased integration&lt;/strong&gt;, follow these well-defined steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, code, test, and debug each class. This step is called &quot;unit development.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the classes into one whopping-big system &quot;system integration&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test and debug the whole system. This is called &quot;system dis-integration.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with phased integration is that when the classes in a system are put together for the first time, new problems inevitably surface and the causes of the problem could be anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;incremental integration&lt;/strong&gt;, you write and test a program in small pieces and then combine the pieces one at a time, it follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a small, functional part of the system. Thoroughly test and debug it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, code, test, and debug a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate the new class with the small functional part of the system then test and debug. Make sure they work before adding new classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for integration affects planning for construction, the order in which components are constructed has to support the order in which they will be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever integration strategy you select, a good approach to integrating the software is the &quot;daily build and smoke test.&quot; Every file is compiled, linked, and combined into an executable program every day, and the program is then put through a &quot;smoke test&quot;, a relatively simple check to see whether the product &quot;smokes&quot; when it runs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Key Construction Decisions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Once we have all the preparation activities done, we can start making construction decisions.

The choice of programming language in which the system will be implemented is a key decision. Studies have shown that the programming-language choice affects productivity and code quality. Programmers working with high-level languages achieve better productivity and quality than those working with lower-level languages. Programmers who program &quot;into&quot; a language first decide what thoughts they want to express, and then they determine how to express those thoughts using the tools provided by their specific language. If your language lacks constructs that you want to use or is prone to other kinds of problems, try to compensate for them. Invent your own coding conventions, standards, class libraries, and other augmentations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[Modeling is the use of metaphor, by comparing a topic you understand poorly to something similar you understand better, this provides better…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/metaphors-for-a-richer-understanding-of-software-development/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/metaphors-for-a-richer-understanding-of-software-development/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modeling is the use of metaphor, by comparing a topic you understand poorly to something similar you understand better, this provides better insights that results in better understanding of a less-familiar topic. Metaphors is a powerful technique that can be used in software development, here is an example from The Pragmatic Programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t Live with Broken Windows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cities there are some buildings that are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulk. Research shows that the main trigger mechanism that turns a clean building into a smashed and abandoned derelict, is a broken window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandoned - a sense that the owner don&apos;t care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple solution to this problem is to fix the broken window as soon as possible so that &lt;em&gt;entropy&lt;/em&gt; disorder doesn&apos;t spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applies to programming called software rot, create clean code so that your software doesn&apos;t rot. Bad code will decrease productivity and you won&apos;t meet the project deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design In Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Although organizing straight-line code is a relatively simple task, some organizational subtleties influence code quality, correctness…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/organizing-straight-line-code/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/organizing-straight-line-code/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although organizing straight-line code is a relatively simple task, some organizational subtleties influence code quality, correctness, readability, and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest sequential statements to order are those in which the order counts. When statements have dependencies that require you to put them in a certain order, take steps to make the dependencies clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might encounter cases in which one statement doesn&apos;t depend on, or logically follow, a statement. But ordering affects readability, performance, and maintainability. Use this guiding principle called Principle of Proximity: &lt;em&gt;keep related actions together&lt;/em&gt;. They can be related because they operate on the same data, perform similar tasks, or depend on each other&apos;s being performed in order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Programming Tools]]></title><description><![CDATA[Use of leading-edge tool set and familiarity with the tools used, can increase productivity by 50 percent or more.

The key distinction between kinds of software evolution is whether the program&apos;s quality improves or degrades under modification. A second distinction is the one between changes made during construction and those made during maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cardinal Rule of Software Evolution is that evolution should improve the internal quality of the program. When you have to make change, strive to improve the code so that future changes are easier. The key strategy is refactoring, &quot;a change made to the internal structure of the software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Table-Driven Methods]]></title><description><![CDATA[A table-driven methods is a scheme that allows you to loop up information in a table rather than using logic statements if and case to…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/table-driven-methods/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/table-driven-methods/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A table-driven methods is a scheme that allows you to loop up information in a table rather than using logic statements if and case to figure it out. Used in appropriate circumstances, table-driven code is simpler than complicated logic, easier to modify, and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use table-driven methods, you have to address two issues. First you have to address the question of how to look up entries in the table. Then second issue you have to address is what you should store in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct-access&lt;/em&gt; table replace more complicated logical control structure, they are &quot;direct access&quot; because you don&apos;t have to jump through any complicated hoops to find the information you want in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use &lt;em&gt;indexed access&lt;/em&gt; scheme, you use the primary data to look up a key in a index table and then you use the value from the index table to look up the main data you&apos;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea of &lt;em&gt;stair-step access&lt;/em&gt; table, is that entries in a table are valid for ranges of data rather for distinct points.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Pseudocode Programming Process]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pseudocode Programming Process PPP, which reduces the work required during design and documentation and improves the quality of both.

The term &quot;pseudocode&quot; refers to an informal, English-like notation for describing how an algorithm, a routine, a class, or a program will work. The PPP defines a specific approach to using pseudocode to streamline the creation of code within routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involves designing the class or routine using pseudocode. After you write the code using the pseudocode as a guideline. Once this is completed, you would check and test the correctness of the code. Repeat a step if necessary. Other approaches are test-first development, refactoring, and design by contract.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Software-Quality Landscape]]></title><description><![CDATA[Software has both external and internal quality characteristics.

External characteristics of quality are the only kind of software characteristics that user care about. Programmers care about both external and internal quality characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software quality assurance is a planned and systematic program of activities designed to ensure that a system has the desired characteristics. Development efforts that include quality-assurance activities produce better software than those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single architectural error can affect several classes and dozens of routines, whereas a single construction error is unlikely to affect more than one routine or class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Principle of Software Quality is that improving quality reduces development costs. The best way to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lists of Characteristics of Software Quality 1-8 are external quaility while 9-15 are internal quality&lt;/h5&gt;

Deals with user-created structured data - &lt;em&gt;structs&lt;/em&gt; in C and C++ and &lt;em&gt;structures&lt;/em&gt; in Microsoft Visual Basic. Classes also sometimes perform as structures when the class consists entirely of public data members with no public routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, every pointer consists of two parts: a location in memory and a knowledge of how to interpret the contents of that location. The location in memory is an address, the pointer itself contains only this address. To use the data the pointer points to, you have to go to that address and interpret the contents of memory at that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global variables are accessible anywhere in a program. Most experienced programmers have concluded that access to data from several routines is pretty useful. Anything you can do with global data, you can do better with access routines. The use of access routines is a core technique for implementing abstract data types and achieving information hiding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Measure Twice, Cut Once - Upstream Prerequiesities]]></title><description><![CDATA[The carpenter's saying, "Measure twice, cut once" is highly relevant to the process before the construction part of software development…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/upstream-prerequisties/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/code-complete/upstream-prerequisties/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The carpenter&apos;s saying, &quot;Measure twice, cut once&quot; is highly relevant to the process before the construction part of software development. Before the construction process there are upstream activities such as architecture, design and project planning. These preparation activities goal is to reduce risk by focusing on improving requirements and project plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Problem Definition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prerequisite is the &quot;problem definition&quot;, define what the problem is without any reference to possible solutions and should sound like a problem. This should be described from a user&apos;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Requirements&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements describe in detail what a software system is supposed to do, and they are the first step toward a solution. Use explicit requirements where the user rather than the programmer drives the system&apos;s functionality, the user can review them and agree to them. Specifying requirements adequately is a key to project success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Architecture&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software architecture is the high-level part of software design, the frame that holds the more detailed parts of the design. The quality of the architecture determines the conceptual integrity of the system, this in turns determines the ultimate quality of the system. Architecture changes are expensive to make, it takes the same time as a needed fix to a requirement error. The cost of architectural changes increases as more code is written for the wrong architecture, so be sure the architecture is right.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Software Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Software construction is similar to construction of house, school, or a skyscraper.

An abstract data type is a collection of data and operations that work on that data. The operations both describe the data to the rest of the program and allow the rest of the program to change the data. Understanding ADT allows programmers to create classes that are easier to implement initially and easier to modify over time. One way of thinking of class is as an abstract data type plus inheritance and polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good interface consists of creating a good abstraction for the interface to represent and ensuring that the details remain hidden behind the abstraction. A class interface provides an abstraction of the implementation that&apos;s hidden behind the interface. Abstraction helps to manage complexity by providing models that allow you to ignore implementation details. Encapsulation is the enforcer that prevents you from looking at the details even if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containment is the simple idea that a class contains a primitive data element or object. One way of thinking of containment is as a &quot;has a&quot; relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheritance is the idea that one class is a specialization of another class. The purpose of inheritance is to create simpler code by defining a base class that specifies common elements of two or more derived classes. Inheritance helps avoid the need to repeat code and data in multiple locations by centralizing it within a base class. When a programmer decides to create a new class by inheriting from an existing class, that programmer is saying that the new class &quot;is a&quot; more specialized version of the older class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Power of Variable Names]]></title><description><![CDATA[The goodness or badness of a variable is largely determined by its name.

The most important consideration in naming a variable is that the name fully and accurately describe the entity the variable represents. A good name tends to express the what more than the how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by W.J. Hansen found that longer names are better for rarely used variables or global variables and shorter names are better for local variables or loop variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using naming conventions for opposite help consistency, which helps readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status variables describe the state of your program. Temporary variable are used to hold intermediate results of calculations, as temporary placeholders, and to hold housekeeping values. Keep typical Boolean names in mind like done, error, found, success or ok. When naming constants, name the abstract entity the constant represent rather than the number the constant refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of naming conventions doesn&apos;t come from the specific convention chosen but from the fact that a convention exist, adding structure to the code and giving you fewer things to worry about. Follow the naming convention of the language you&apos;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standardizing prefixes for common meanings provides a terse but consistent and readable approach to naming data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zero Bugs And Program Faster]]></title><description><![CDATA[A wise man learns by the mistakes of others, a fool only by his own.

&lt;p&gt;A wise man learns by the mistakes of others, a fool only by his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make sure you update, compile, and test the code before committing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the golden rule of programming, the straight brick road to perfection: whenever a mistake happens, ask yourself how to avoid that mistake in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function calls require thinking. Read the documentation. Double-check to make sure you know what the function is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debugging code is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as complexly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All errors will be within 3 lines of the place you last changed the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test every line of code. Write a small test, then write the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you change a line of code, double check everywhere related to that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your code is not &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; beautiful when you write it, don&apos;t despair. It never will be. Satisfy yourself when it&apos;s good enough, and do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t matter how good you are at programming. Your code can be improved when people look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people make a mistake: they try to optimize without collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always attack your own ideas the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone points out a mistake, it&apos;s a chance to grow. People who are honest with you and point out your mistakes are in some ways true friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good applications are discoverable, meaning they can be used without reading a manual. Good code is discoverable, meaning things are easy to find. When you create a feature, ask yourself, &quot;How will the user discover this feature?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If code is discoverable, users will seek greater knowledge of the system. If code is not discoverable, users will copy and paste from examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Thompson: &quot;Good code, there&apos;s one place where you add that feature and it fits; fragile code, you&apos;ve got to touch ten places.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing code before it needs to be written is poor management. Never do today what can be put off to tomorrow. You may not have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something will be easier to do now than later, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing mistakes, instead of starting over from scratch, is the way to learn. The first step to perfection is learning how to recover when you aren&apos;t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making variables immutable, that is unchangeable. &quot;Control of side effect.&quot; When you know that calling a function will have zero side effects, bugs melt away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protected action; if something goes wrong while you are doing the action, it can be reversed. When an action cannot be reversed, it is called a real action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fail fast explained by Jim Shore: &quot;When a problem occurs, the system fails immediately and visibly. Failing fast is a nonintuitive technique; it sounds like it would make your software more fragile, but it actually makes it more robust. Bugs are easier to find and fix, so fewer go into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important concept for proving code correctness is the preconditions and post condition. The preconditions says what can be passed in to a function, and the post conditions describes the state after the function is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An invariant is always true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Show me your interface and I won&apos;t need your code because it&apos;ll be redundant and irrelevant,&quot; says Guy Steele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lazy method list all edge cases, exceptions, side effects, and errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key observation of the top down side is that it&apos;s helpful to know what you&apos;re building before you build it. The key observation of the bottom up side is you need to know what tools you have before you can design it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in your life you will be called on to judge code. When that happens, these three criteria will help you. Functionality, readability, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to improve your programming is to look at examples of code written by others.&lt;/p&gt;

The time taken by an algorithm grows with the size of the input, so it is traditional to describe the running time of a program as a function of the size of its input. To do so, we need to define the terms &quot;running time&quot; and &quot;size of input&quot; more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input size&lt;/strong&gt; depends on the problem being studied. For many problems the &lt;em&gt;number of items in the input&lt;/em&gt;, or it may be &lt;em&gt;total numbers of bits&lt;/em&gt; needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running time&lt;/strong&gt; of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive operations or &quot;steps&quot; executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part of the book, the focus will be on the &lt;strong&gt;worst-case running time&lt;/strong&gt;, the longest running time for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; input of size $n$. The reason why is this running time gives us the upper bound on the running time for any input of size $n$ guarantee that the algorithm will never take any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of growth&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;order of growth&lt;/strong&gt; of the running time, we consider only the leading term of the running time function and also ignore the leading term&apos;s constant coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;strong&gt;loop invariants&lt;/strong&gt; to help us understand why an algorithm is correct, it must satisfy the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initialization&lt;/strong&gt;: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination&lt;/strong&gt;: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;median&lt;/strong&gt;, informally, is the &quot;halfway point&quot; of the set. When $n$ is odd, the median is unique, occuring at $i = (n + 1) / 2$. When $n$ is even, there are two medians, occurring at $i = n / 2$ and $i = n / 2 + 1$.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binary Search Trees]]></title><description><![CDATA[We can represent such a tree by a linked data structure in which each node is an object.

In addition to a &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;satellite data&lt;/strong&gt;, each node contains attributes &lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt; that point to the nodes corresponding to its left child, its right child, and its parent, respectively. If a child or the parent is missing, the appropriate attribute contains the value $NIL$. The root node is the only node in the tree whose parent is $NIL$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the &lt;strong&gt;binary-search-tree property&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $x$ be a node in a binary search tree. If $y$ is a node in the left subtree of $x$, then $y.key \leq x.key$. If $y$ is a node in the right subtree of $x$, then $y.key \geq x.key$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary-search-tree property allow us to print out all the keys in a binary search tree in sorted order by a simple recursive algorithm, called an &lt;strong&gt;inorder tree walk&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a pointer to the root of the tree and a let $k$, &lt;strong&gt;TREE-SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; returns a pointer to a node with key $k$ if one exists; otherwise, it return $NIL$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;TREE-SEARCH x,k&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; NIL or k &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; k &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; TREE&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;SEARCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;k&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; TREE&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;SEARCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;right&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;k&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the iterative algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH x,k&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; NIL and k &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key
      x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;right
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure begins its search at the root and traces a simple path downward in the tree. For each node $x$ it encounters, it compares the key $k$ with $x.key$. If the two keys are equal, the search terminates. If $k$ is smaller than $x.key$, the search continues in the left subtree of $x$, since the binary-search-tree property implies that $k$ could not be stored in the right subtree. Symmetrically, if $k$ is larger than $x.key$, the search continues in the right subtree. The running time of &lt;strong&gt;TREE-SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; is $\Theta(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree. Use Figure 12.2 in the book for visualization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can always find an element in a binary search tree whose key is a minimum by following &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; child pointers from the root until we encounter a $NIL$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;TREE-MINIMUM x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
    x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pseudocode for &lt;strong&gt;TREE-MAXIMUM&lt;/strong&gt; is symmetric:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;TREE-MAXIMUM x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;right &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
    x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;right
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both run in $\Theta(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can implement the dynamic-set operations &lt;strong&gt;SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MINIMUM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SUCCESSOR&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PREDECESSOR&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;INSERT&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt; so that each one runs in $\Theta(h)$ time on binary search tree of height $h$.&lt;/p&gt;

This sorting algorithm is comparison based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and elements are swapped if they are not in order.

Since the maximum element of the array is stored at the root $A[1]$, we can put it into its correct final position by exchanging it with $A[n]$. If we now discard node $n$ from the heap and we can do so by simply decrementing $A.heap-size$, we observe that the children of the root remain max-heaps, but the new root element might violate the max-heap property. All we need to do to restore the max-heap property, however, is call &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY A,1&lt;/strong&gt;, which leaves a max-heap in $A[1..n - 1]$. The heapsort algorithm then repeats this process for the max-heap of size $n-1$ down to a heap of size 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;: A sequence of $n$ numbers $&lt;a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ouput&lt;/strong&gt;: A permutation reordering $&lt;a&apos;_1,a&apos;_2,\cdots,a&apos;n&gt;$ of the input sequence such that $a&apos;_1 \leq a&apos;_2 \leq \cdots \leq a&apos;_n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length downto &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    exchange &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;HEAPSORT&lt;/strong&gt; procedure takes time $\Theta(n \\ lg \\ n)$, since the call to &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; takes time $\Theta(n)$ and each of the $n - 1$ calls to &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; takes time $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

When $k = O(n)$, the sort runs in $\Theta(n)$ time. This algorithm determines, for each input element $x$, the number of elements less than $x$. It uses this information to place element $x$ directly into its position in the output array. We must modify this scheme slightly to handle the situation in which several elements have the same value, since we do not want to put them all in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume that the input is an array $A[1..n]$ and thus $A.length = n$. We require two other arrays: the array $B[1..n]$ holds the sorted output, and the array $C[0..k]$ provides temporary working storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall time it takes is $\Theta(k + n)$, in practice, we usually use counting sort when we have $k = O(n)$, in which case the running time is $\Theta(n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important property of counting sort is that it is &lt;strong&gt;stable&lt;/strong&gt;: numbers with the same value appear in the output array in the same order as they do in the input array. Counting sort is often used as a subroutine in radix sort.&lt;/p&gt;

Although searching for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a linked list, $\Theta(n)$ time in the worst case, in practice, hashing performs extremely well. The average time to search for an elment in a hash table is $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Direct-Address Table&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe $U$ of keys is reasonably small. Suppose that an application needs a dynamic set in which each element has a key drawn from the universe $U = \{0, 1,..., m - 1\}$, where $m$ is not too large. We shall assume that no two elements have the same key. Use Figure 11.1 in the book for more visualization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of direct addressing: if universe $U$ is large, storing a table $T$ of size $U$ may be impractical. Furthermore, the set $K$ of keys &lt;em&gt;actually stored&lt;/em&gt; may be so small relative to $U$ that most of the space allocated for $T$ would be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Hash Tables&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the set $K$ of keys stored in a dictionary is much smaller than the universe $U$ of all possible keys, a hash table requires much less storage than a direct-address table. With hashing, this element is stored in slot $h(k)$; this is, we use a &lt;strong&gt;hash function&lt;/strong&gt; $h$ to compute the slot from the key $k$. Here, $h$ maps the universe $U$ of keys into the slots of a &lt;strong&gt;hash table&lt;/strong&gt; $T$ $\{0,1,...,m - 1\}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$h: U \to \{ 0,1,...,m - 1 \}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the size $m$ of the hash table is typically much less than $U$. We say that an element with key $k$ &lt;strong&gt;hashes&lt;/strong&gt; to slot $h(k)$; we also say that $h(k)$ is the &lt;strong&gt;hash value&lt;/strong&gt; of key $k$. Use Figure 11.2 in the book for more visualization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hash function reduces the range of array indices and hence the size of the array. There is one hitch: two key may hash to the same slot. We call this situation a &lt;strong&gt;collision&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Collision Resolution By Chaining&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;chaining&lt;/strong&gt;, we place all the elements that hash to the same slot into the same linked list. Slot $j$ contains a pointer to the head of the list of all stored elements that hash to $j$; if there are no such elements, slot $j$ contains $NIL$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a hash table $T$ with $m$ slots that stores $n$ elements, we defined the &lt;strong&gt;load factor&lt;/strong&gt; $\alpha$ for $T$ as $\frac{n}{m}$, that is, the average number of elements stored in a chain. Use Figure 11.2 in the book for more visualization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-case behavior of hashing with chaining: all $n$ keys hash to the same slot, creating a list of length $n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average-case performance of hashing depends on how well the hash function $h$ distributes the set of keys to be stored among the $m$ slots, on the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What Makes A Good Hash Function?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good hash function satisfies approximately the assumption of simple uniform hashing: each key is equally likely to hash to any of the $m$ slots, independently of where any other key has hashed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the schemes, hashing by division and hashing by multiplication, are heuristic in nature, whereas the third scheme, universal hashing, uses randomization to provide provably good performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Insertion Sort]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements, using the incremental approach: having sorted the subarray , we…]]></description><link>https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/introduction-to-algorithms/insertion-sort/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/books/introduction-to-algorithms/insertion-sort/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements, using the &lt;strong&gt;incremental&lt;/strong&gt; approach: having sorted the subarray $A[1..j - 1]$, we inserted the single element $A[j]$ into its proper place, yielding the sorted subarray $A[1..j]$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;: A sequence of $n$ numbers $&lt;a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ouput&lt;/strong&gt;: A permutation reordering $&lt;a&apos;_1,a&apos;_2,\cdots,a&apos;n&gt;$ of the input sequence such that $a&apos;_1 \leq a&apos;_2 \leq \cdots \leq a&apos;_n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position in the left hand.To find the correct position for a card, we compare it with each of the cards already in the hand, right to left. At all times, the cards held in the left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of the pile on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;INSERTION-SORT A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;pseudocode&lt;/em&gt; takes as a parameter an array $A[1..n]$ containing a sequence of length $n$ that is to be sorted. The algorithm sorts the input numbers &lt;strong&gt;in place&lt;/strong&gt;: it rearranges the numbers within the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The index $j$ indicates the &quot;current card&quot; being inserted into the subarray consisting of elements $A[1..j - 1]$ currently sorted array. The remaining subarray $A[j + 1..n]$ corresponds to the unordered array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements $A[1..j - 1]$ are the elements &lt;em&gt;originally&lt;/em&gt; in positions $1$ through $j - 1$, but now in sorted order, this is known as &lt;strong&gt;loop invariant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best-case occurs if the array is already sorted and the best-case running time will be a &lt;strong&gt;linear function&lt;/strong&gt; of $n$, $\Theta(n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-case occurs when the array is in reverse sorted order and the worst-case running time is a &lt;strong&gt;quadratic function&lt;/strong&gt; of $n$, $\Theta(n^2)$.&lt;/p&gt;

An array $A$ that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: $A.length$, which as usual gives the number of elements in the array, and $A.heap-size$, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array $A$. The root of the tree is $A[1]$, and given the index $i$ of a node, we can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PARENT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ \lfloor \frac{i}{2} \rfloor$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LEFT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ 2i$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;RIGHT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ 2i + 1$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for $A[1]$ where 1 is the first element in the array, when using 0 based index use the following below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PARENT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ \lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \rfloor$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LEFT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ 2i + 1$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;RIGHT i&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$return \ 2i + 2$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define the &lt;strong&gt;height of a node&lt;/strong&gt; in a heap to be the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and we define the &lt;strong&gt;height of the heap&lt;/strong&gt; to be the height of its root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of binary heaps: &lt;strong&gt;max-heaps&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;min-heaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Max-heap&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;max-heap property&lt;/strong&gt; is that for every node $i$ other than the root,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$A[PARENT(i)] \geq A[i]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root $A[1]$ the first element in the array&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain the max-heap property, we call the procedure &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt;. Its input are an array $A$ and an index $i$ into the array. Assuming that the binary trees rooted at $LEFT(i)$ and $RIGHT(i)$ are max-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; lets the value at $A[i]$ &quot;float down&quot; in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the max-heap property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY A,i&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each step, the largest of the elements $A[i]$, $A[LEFT(i)]$, and $A[RIGHT(i)]$ is determined, and its index is stored in largest. If $A[i]$ is largest, then the subtree rooted at node $i$ is already a max-heap and the procedure terminates. Otherwise, one of the two children has the largest element, and $A[i]$ is swapped with $A[largest]$, which causes node $i$ and its children to satify the max-heap property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-case running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Min-heap&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$A[PARENT(i)] \leq A[i]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain the min-heap property, we call the procedure &lt;strong&gt;MIN-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt;. Its input are an array $A$ and an index $i$ into the array. Assuming that the binary trees rooted at $LEFT(i)$ and $RIGHT(i)$ are min-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be greater than its children, thus violating the min-heap property. &lt;strong&gt;MIN-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; lets the value at $A[i]$ &quot;float down&quot; in the min-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the min-heap property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each step, the lowest of the elements $A[i]$, $A[LEFT(i)]$, and $A[RIGHT(i)]$ is determined, and its index is stored in lowest. If $A[i]$ is lowest, then the subtree rooted at node $i$ is already a max-heap and the procedure terminates. Otherwise, one of the two children has the lowest element, and $A[i]$ is swapped with $A[lowest]$, which causes node $i$ and its children to satify the min-heap property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-case running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;doubly linked list&lt;/strong&gt; $L$ is an object with an attribute $key$ and two other pointer attribute: &lt;strong&gt;next&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;prev&lt;/strong&gt;. Given an element $x$ in the list, $x.next$ points to its &lt;strong&gt;successor&lt;/strong&gt; in the linked list, and $x.prev$ points to its &lt;strong&gt;predecessor&lt;/strong&gt;. If $x.prev = NIL$, the element $x$ has no predecessor and is therefore the first element, or &lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt;, of the list. If $x.next = NIL$, the element $x$ has no successor and is therefore the last element, or &lt;strong&gt;tail&lt;/strong&gt;, of the list. An attribute $L.head$ points to the first element of the list. If $L.head = NIL$, the list is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list may have one of several forms. It may be either singly linked or doubly linked, it may be sorted or not, and it may be circular or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singly linked&lt;/strong&gt;, we omit the &lt;em&gt;prev&lt;/em&gt; pointer in each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;sorted&lt;/strong&gt; list, the linear order of the list corresponds to the linear order of keys stored in elements of the list; the minimum element is then the head of the list, and the maximum element is the tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;unsorted&lt;/strong&gt; list, the elements can appear in any order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;circular&lt;/strong&gt; list, the &lt;em&gt;prev&lt;/em&gt; pointer of the head of the list points to the tail, and the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; pointer of the tail of the list points to the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Searching a linked list&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure &lt;strong&gt;LIST-SEARCH L,k&lt;/strong&gt; finds the first element with key $k$ in list $L$ by a simple linear search, returning a pointer to this element. If no object with key $k$ appears in the list, then the procedure return $NIL$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LIST=SEARCH L,k&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head
  whilte x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; NIL and x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; k
    x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search a list of $n$ objects, the &lt;strong&gt;LIST-SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; procedure takes $\Theta(n)$ time in the worst case, since it may have to search the entire list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Inserting into a linked list&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given an element $x$ whose $key$ attribute has already been set, &lt;strong&gt;LIST-INSERT&lt;/strong&gt; procedure &quot;splices&quot; $x$ onto the front of the linked list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LIST-INSERT L,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; NIL
    &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x
  &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x
  x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; NIL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running time for &lt;strong&gt;LIST-INSERT&lt;/strong&gt; on a list of $n$ elements is $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Deleting from a linked list&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure &lt;strong&gt;LIST-DELETE&lt;/strong&gt; removes an element $x$ from a linked list $L$. It must be given a pointer to $x$, and it then &quot;splices&quot; x out of list by updating pointers. If we wish to delete an element with a given key, we must first call &lt;strong&gt;LIST-SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; to retrieve a pointer to the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;LIST-DELETE L,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; NIL
    x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;head &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; NIL
    x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIST-DELETE&lt;/strong&gt; runs in $\Theta(1)$, but if we wish to delete an element with a given key, $\Theta(n)$ time is required in the worst case because we must first call &lt;strong&gt;LIST-SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; to find the element.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Max Heap]]></title><description><![CDATA[We can use the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY in a bottom-up manner to convert an array , where , into a max-heap.

The elements in the subarray $A[(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} + 1 \rfloor )..n]$ are all leaves of the tree, and so each is a 1-element heap to begin with. The procedure &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; goes through the remaining nodes of the tree and run &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;heap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;size &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; downto &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    MAX&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;HEAPIFY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; works correctly, we use the following loop invariant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each iteration of the for loop, each node $i + 1, i + 2, \dots, n$ is the root of a max-heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running time of &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; as follows, each call to &lt;strong&gt;MAX-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; costs $\Theta(lg \\ n)$ time, and &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MAX-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; makes $\Theta(n)$. Thus, the running time is $\Theta(n \\ lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;: A sequence of $n$ numbers $&lt;a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ouput&lt;/strong&gt;: A permutation reordering $&lt;a&apos;_1,a&apos;_2,\cdots,a&apos;n&gt;$ of the input sequence such that $a&apos;_1 \leq a&apos;_2 \leq \cdots \leq a&apos;_n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Involves the following three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide&lt;/strong&gt;: Divide the $n$-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequence of $\frac{n}{2}$ element each, $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conquer&lt;/strong&gt;: Sort the two subsequences recurseively using merge sort, $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine&lt;/strong&gt;: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer, $\Theta(n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key operation of this algorithm is the combine step, &lt;strong&gt;MERGE A, p, q, r&lt;/strong&gt;, where $A$ is an array and $p$, $q$, and $r$ are indices into the array such that $p \leq q &lt; r$. This procedure assumes that the subarrays $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ are in sorted order. It &lt;strong&gt;merges&lt;/strong&gt; them to form a single sorted subarray that replaces the current subarray $A[p..r]$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Suppose we have two piles of cards face up on a table. Each pile is sorted, with the smallest cards on top. We wish to merge the two piles into a single sorted output pile, which is to be face down on the table. Our basic step consists of choosing the smaller of the two cards on top of the face-up piles, removing it from its pile (which exposes a new top card), and placing this card face down onto the output file. We repeat this step until one input pile is empty, at which time we just take the remaining input pile and place it face down onto the output pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MERGE A,p,q,r&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;pseudocode&lt;/em&gt; uses &lt;strong&gt;sentinel&lt;/strong&gt; card at the bottom of each pile, this sentinel value helps check for when the pile is empty. In the code it is denoted as $\infty$, once a card with $\infty$ is exposed it cannot be the smaller card unless both piles have their sentinel cards exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created two arrays $L$ (left $A[p..q]$) and $R$ (right $A[q + 1..r]$), of length $n_1 + 1$ and $n_2 + 1$ (extra position holds the sentinel) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop invariant: At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $A[p..k - 1]$ contains the $k - p$ smallest elements of $L[1..n_1 + 1]$ and $R[1..n_2 +1]$, in sorted order. Moreover, $L[i]$ and $R[j]$ are the smallest elements of their arrays that have not been copied back into A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can use the &lt;strong&gt;MERGE&lt;/strong&gt; procedure as a subroutine in the merge sort algorithm. The procedure &lt;strong&gt;MERGE-SORT(A,p,r)&lt;/strong&gt; sorts the elements in the subarray $A[p..r]$. If $p \geq r$, the subarray has at most one element and is therefore already sorted. Otherwise, the divide step simply computes an index $q$ that partitions $A[p..r]$ into two subarrays: $A[p..q]$, containing $[\frac{n}{2}]$ elements, and $A[q + 1..r]$, containing $[\frac{n}{2}]$ elements.&lt;/p&gt;

The elements in the subarray $A[(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} + 1 \rfloor )..n]$ are all leaves of the tree, and so each is a 1-element heap to begin with. The procedure &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MIN-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; goes through the remaining nodes of the tree and run &lt;strong&gt;MIN-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;BUILD-MIN-HEAP A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;heap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;size &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; downto &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    MIN&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;HEAPIFY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MIN-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; works correctly, we use the following loop invariant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each iteration of the for loop, each node $i + 1, i + 2, \dots, n$ is the root of a min-heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running time of &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MIN-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; as follows, each call to &lt;strong&gt;MIN-HEAPIFY&lt;/strong&gt; costs $\Theta(lg \\ n)$ time, and &lt;strong&gt;BUILD-MIN-HEAP&lt;/strong&gt; makes $\Theta(n)$. Thus, the running time is $\Theta(n \\ lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Java Implementation&lt;/h5&gt;

Priority queues come in two forms: &lt;em&gt;max-priority queues&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;min-priority queues&lt;/em&gt;. In a given application, such as job scheduling or event-driven simulation, element of a priority queue correspond to objects in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;priority queue&lt;/strong&gt; is a data structure for maintaining a set $S$ of elements, each with an associated value called a &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;strong&gt;max-priority queue&lt;/strong&gt; supports the following operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$INSERT(S,x)$ inserts the element $x$ into the set $S$, which is equivalent to the operation $S = S \cup {x}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$MAXIMUM(S)$ removes and returns the element of $S$ with the largest key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$EXTRACT-MAX(S)$ removes and returns the element of $S$ with the largest key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$INCREASE-KEY(S,x,k)$ increases the value of element $x&apos;s$ key to the new value $k$, which is assumed to be at least as large as $x&apos;s$ current key value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use a heap to implement a priority queue, we often need to store a &lt;strong&gt;handle&lt;/strong&gt; to the corresponding application object in each heap element. The exact makeup of the handle such as a pointer or an integer depends on the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HEAP-MAXIMUM A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure $HEAP-MAXIMUM$ implements the &lt;strong&gt;MAXIMUM&lt;/strong&gt; operation in $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure &lt;strong&gt;HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX&lt;/strong&gt; implements the &lt;strong&gt;EXTRACT-MAX&lt;/strong&gt; operation, the running time of &lt;strong&gt;HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX&lt;/strong&gt; is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;heap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;size &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;HEAP-INCREASE-KEY A,i,key&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure &lt;strong&gt;HEAP-INCREASE-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; implements the &lt;strong&gt;INCREASE-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; operation. An index $i$ into the array identifies the priority-queue element whose key we wish to increase. The procedure first updates the key of element $A[i]$ to its new value. Because increasing the key of $A[i]$ might violate the max-heap property, the procedure then, traverses a simple path from this node toward the root to find a proper place for the newly increased key. As &lt;strong&gt;HEAP-INCREASE-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; traverses this path, it repeatedly compares an element to its parent, exchanging their keys and continuing if the element&apos;s key is larger,, and terminating if the element&apos;s key is smaller, since the max-heap property now holds. The running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;MAX-HEAP-INSERT A,key&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure is an &lt;em&gt;insert&lt;/em&gt; operation, it takes as an input the key of the new element to be inserted into max-heap $A$, The procedure first expands the max-heap by adding to the tree a new leaf whose key is $- \infty$. Then it calls &lt;strong&gt;HEAP-INCREASE-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; to set the key of this new node to its correct value and maintain the max-heap property. The running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

We call the &lt;strong&gt;INSERT&lt;/strong&gt; operation on a queue &lt;strong&gt;ENQUEUE&lt;/strong&gt;, and we call the &lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt; operation &lt;strong&gt;DEQUEUE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIFO property of a queue causes it to operate like a line of customers waiting to pay a cashier. The queue has a &lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;tail&lt;/strong&gt;. When a element is enqueued, it takes its place at the tail of the queue, just as a newly arriving customer takes a place at the end of the line. The element dequeued is always the one at the head of the queue, like the customer at the head of the line who has waited the longest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to implement a queue of at most $n - 1$ elements using an array $Q[1..n]$. The queue has an attribute $Q.head$ that indexes, or points to, its head. The attribute $Q.tail$ indexes the next location at which a newly arriving element will be inserted into the queue. The elements in the queue reside in the locations $Q.head, Q.head + 1, ..., Q.tail-1$. When $Q.head = Q.tail$, the queue is empty, initially we have $Q.head = Q.tail = 1$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we attempt to dequeue an element from an empty queue, the queue &lt;strong&gt;underflows&lt;/strong&gt;. When $Q.head = Q.tail + 1$, the queue is full, and if we attempt to enqueue an elment, then the queue &lt;strong&gt;overflows&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each operation takes takes $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;ENQUEUE Q,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tail&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x

Here is the three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting a subarray $A[p..r]$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide&lt;/strong&gt;: Partition rearrange the array $A[p..r]$ into two (possible empty) subarrays $A[p..q - 1]$ and $A[q + 1..r]$ such that each element of $A[p..q - 1]$ is less than or equal to $A[q]$, which is, in turn, less than or equal to each element of $A[q + 1..r]$. Compute the index q as part of this partitioning procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conquer&lt;/strong&gt;: Sort the two subarrays $A[p..q - 1]$ and $A[q + 1..r]$ by recursive calls to quicksort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the subarrays are already sorted, no work is needed to combine them: the entire array $A[p..r]$ is now sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;QUICKSORT A,p,r&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% highlight java %}
if p &amp;#x3C; r
q = PARTITION(A,p,r)
QUICKSORT(A,p,q - 1)
QUICKSORT(A,q + 1,r)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the algorithm is the &lt;strong&gt;PARTITION&lt;/strong&gt; procedure, which rearranges the subarray $A[p..r]$ in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PARTITION A,p,r&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% highlight java %}
x = A[r]
i = p - 1
for j = p to r - 1
if A[j] &amp;#x3C;= x
i = i + 1
exchange A[i] with A[j]
exchange A[i + 1] with A[r]
return i + 1
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARTITION&lt;/strong&gt; always selects an element $x = A[r]$ as a &lt;strong&gt;pivot&lt;/strong&gt; element around which to partition the subarray $A[p..r]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop invariant: At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, for any array index k&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $p \leq k \leq, then A[k] \leq x$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $i + 1 \leq k \leq j - 1, then A[k] &gt; x$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $k = r, then A[k] = x$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quicksort algorithm has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(n^2)$, this occurs when the partitioning produces subproblem with $n - 1$ elements and one with 0 elements. The best-case running time is when the partitioning produces two subproblem, each of size no more than $\frac{n}{2}$ which is $\Theta(n \\ lg \\ n)$. The average-case running time of quicksort is much closer to the best case than to the worst case.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;strong&gt;dictionary&lt;/strong&gt; are dynamic set that supports the following operations: insert elements into, delete elements from, and test membership in a set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical implementation of a dynamic set, each element is represented by an object whose attributes can be examined and manipulated if we have a pointer to the object. Some kinds of dynamic sets assume that one of the object&apos;s attributes is an identifying &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt;. The object may contain &lt;strong&gt;satellite data&lt;/strong&gt;, which are carried around in other object attributes but are otherwise unused by the set implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Operations on dynamic sets&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations on a dynamic set can be grouped into two categories: &lt;strong&gt;queries&lt;/strong&gt;, which simply return information about the set, and &lt;strong&gt;modifying operations&lt;/strong&gt;, which change the set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;SEARCH S,k&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query that, given a set $S$ and a key value $k$, return a pointer $x$ to an element in $S$ such that $x.key = k$, or $NIL$ if no such element belongs to $S$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;INSERT S,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modifying operation that augments the set $S$ with the element pointed to by $x$. We usually assume that any attributes in element $x$ needed by the set implementation have already been initialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;DELETE S,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modifying operation that, given a pointer $x$ to an element in the set $S$, removes $x$ from $S$. Note that this operation takes a pointer to an element $x$, not a key value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MINIMUM S&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query on a totally ordered set $S$ that returns a pointer to the element of $S$ with the smallest key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MAXIMUM S&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query on a totally ordered set $S$ that returns a pointer to the element of $S$ with the largest key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;SUCCESSOR S,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query that, given an element $x$ whose key is from a totally ordered set $S$, return a pointer to the next larger element in $S$, or $NIL$ if $x$ is the maximum element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;PREDECESSOR S,x&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query that, given an element $x$ whose key is from a totally ordered set $S$, return a pointer to the next smaller element in $S$, or $NIL$ if $x$ is the minimum element.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Randomized Quicksort]]></title><description><![CDATA[Instead of always using  as the pivot, we will select a randomly chosen element from the subarray .

We do so by first exchanging element $A[r]$ with an element chosen at random from $A[p..r]$. By randomly sampling the range $p,...,r$, we ensure that the pivot element $x = A[r]$ is equally likely to be any of the $r - p + 1$ elements in the subarray. Because we randomly choose the pivot element, we expect the split of the input array to be reasonably well balanced on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;RANDOMIZED-PARTITION A,p,r&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;RANDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  exchange &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;PARTITION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new quicksort calls &lt;strong&gt;RANDOMIZED-PARTITION&lt;/strong&gt; in place of &lt;strong&gt;PARTITION&lt;/strong&gt;, note that &lt;strong&gt;PARTITION&lt;/strong&gt; is inside &amp;#x3C;a href=&quot;{{ &quot;/quick-sort/&quot; | prepend: site.baseurl }}&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quicksort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;

    RANDOMIZED&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;QUICKSORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;q &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    RANDOMIZED&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;QUICKSORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;q &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst case running time happens on the worst partitioning case which produces $\Theta(n^2)$. The expected running time of this algorithm is $\Theta(n \\ lg \\ n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;INSERT&lt;/strong&gt; operation on a stack is often called &lt;strong&gt;PUSH&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt; operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called &lt;strong&gt;POP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can implement a stack of at most $n$ elements with an array $S[1..n]$. The array has an attribute $S.top$ that indexes the most recently inserted element. The stack consists of elements $S[1..S.top]$, where $S[1]$ is the element at the bottom of the stack and $S[S.top]$ is the element at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $S.top = 0$, the stack contains no elements and is &lt;strong&gt;empty&lt;/strong&gt;. We can test to see whether the stack is empty by query operation &lt;strong&gt;STACK-EMPTY&lt;/strong&gt;. If we attempt to pop an empty stack, we say the stack &lt;strong&gt;underflows&lt;/strong&gt;, which is normally an error. If $S.top$ exceeds $n$, the stack &lt;strong&gt;overflows&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the three stack operation takes $\Theta(1)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Initially sorted part is empty and unsorted part is entire list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element and that element becomes part of sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is not suitable for large data set as its average and worst case complexity are of $\Theta(n^2)$ where $n$ are number of items.&lt;/p&gt;

The algorithm then combines the cards into a single deck. Then it sorts the entire deck again on the second-least significant digit and recombines the deck in a like manner. The process continues until the cards have been sorted on all $d$ digits. Remarkably, at that point the cards are fully sorted on the $d$-digit number. Thus, only $d$ passes through the deck are required to sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following procedure assumes that each element in the $n$-element array $A$ has $d$ digits, where digit 1 is the lowest-order digit and digit $d$ is the highest-order digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;RADIX-SORT A,d&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
    use a stable sort &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt; array &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; on digit i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: A example of a stable sort is &amp;#x3C;a href=&quot;{{ &quot;/counting-sort/&quot; | prepend: site.baseurl }}&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counting Sort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given $n$ $d$-digit numbers in which each digit can take on up to $k$ possible values, &lt;strong&gt;RADIX-SORT&lt;/strong&gt; correctly sorts these number in $\Theta(d(n + k))$ time if the stable sort it uses take $\Theta(n + k)$ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invest in your knowledge portfolio, your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A Pragmatic Approach&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During development focus on orthogonality by reducing duplication in the system, remember to use Tracer Code or Prototyping when implementing new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Basic Tools&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every craftsman starts his or her journey with tools, spend time learning to use these tools, and at some point you&apos;ll be surprised to discover your fingers moving over the keyboard, manipulating text without conscious thought. The tools well have become extensions of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pragmatic Paranoia&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect software doesn&apos;t exist, use this to your advantage by applying techniques that test for the correctness of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t write perfect software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Bend, or Break&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is constantly changing, so does your code, focus on producing flexible and adaptable software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;While You Are Coding&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers who don&apos;t actively think about their code or programming by coincidence - the code might work, but there&apos;s no particular reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid programming by coincidence - relying on luck and accidental successes - in favoring of programming deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Before the Project&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirement gathering rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they&apos;re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work with a user to think like a user&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pragmatic Projects&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Terms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entropy&lt;/strong&gt; is a term from physics that refers to the amount of &quot;disorder&quot; in a system. When disorder increases in software, programmers call it &quot;software rot&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&apos;t Repeat Yourself DRY&lt;/strong&gt;, every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthogonality&lt;/strong&gt;, two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;, components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversibility&lt;/strong&gt; means producing flexible and adaptable software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracer code&lt;/strong&gt; is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt; generates disposable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracing statements&lt;/strong&gt; are used to watch the state of a program or a data structure over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubber Ducking&lt;/strong&gt; a useful technique for finding the cause of a problem is simply to explain it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Generators&lt;/strong&gt; are code that writes code, task of producing the same code over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design by Contract DBC&lt;/strong&gt; a powerful technique that focuses on documenting and agreeing to the rights and responsibilities of software modules to ensure program correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy code&lt;/strong&gt;: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coupling&lt;/strong&gt;, the dependencies among modules of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shy code&lt;/strong&gt;: don&apos;t reveal yourself to others, and don&apos;t interact with too many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoupling&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing the dependencies among modules of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law of Demeter for functions&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to minimize coupling between modules in any given program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata&lt;/strong&gt; is any data that describes the application - how it should run, what resources it should use, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal coupling&lt;/strong&gt; is about time dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; are things happening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-View-Controller MVC&lt;/strong&gt;: separating the model from both the GUI that represents it and the controls that manage the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big O Notation&lt;/strong&gt;: estimating the resources that algorithms use - time, processor, memory, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Array =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;O1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple loops =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested loops =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Om x n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary chop =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Olgn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide and Conquer =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;n lgn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premature optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: a good idea to make sure an algorithm really is a bottleneck before investing your precious time trying to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring&lt;/strong&gt;: rewriting, reworking, and re-architecting code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unit Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: testing done on each module, in isolation, to verify its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing against contract&lt;/strong&gt; tells us two things: whether the code meets the contract, and whether the contracts means what we think it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documenting Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;, you want to write likely scenarios that describe what the application need to do and publish a document that everyone can use as a basis for discussions - the developers, the end users, and the project sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use cases&lt;/strong&gt;: describe a particular use of the system - not in terms of user interface, but in a more abstract fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt; are not architecture. Requirements are not designs, nor are they the user interface. Requirements are need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project glossary&lt;/strong&gt; - one place that defines all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project specification&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of taking a requirement and reducing it down to the point where a programmer&apos;s skill can take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless approach&lt;/strong&gt;: specification and implementation are simply different aspects of the same process - an attempt to capture and codify a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality officer&lt;/strong&gt; - someone to whom the team delegates the responsibility for the quality of the deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chief water tester&lt;/strong&gt;: this person check constantly for increased scope, decreased time scales, additional features, new environments - anything that wasn&apos;t in the original agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project librarian&lt;/strong&gt;: responsible for coordinating documentation and code repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool Builders&lt;/strong&gt;: to construct and deploy the tools that automate the project drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;build&lt;/strong&gt; is a procedure that takes on empty directory and builds the project from scratch, producing whatever you hope to produce as a final deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final builds&lt;/strong&gt;: which you intend to ship as products, may have different requirement from the regular nightly build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration testing&lt;/strong&gt; shows that the major subsystem that make up the project work and play well with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-world conditions&lt;/strong&gt;, in the real world, your programs don&apos;t have limitless resources; they run out of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression test&lt;/strong&gt; compares the output of the current test with previous or known values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test data&lt;/strong&gt;: there are only two kinds of data: real-world data and synthetic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coverage analysis&lt;/strong&gt; tools watch your code during testing and keep track of which lines of code have been executed and which haven&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal documentation&lt;/strong&gt; includes source code comments, design and test document, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External documentation&lt;/strong&gt; is anything shipped or published to the outside world, such as user manuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clean Code - A Handbook Of Agile Software Craftsmanship]]></title><description><![CDATA[Clean Code Bad code will bring the company down!

&lt;p&gt;Bad code will bring the company down! It&apos;s obvious that messy code takes longer to understand. As the mess continues, productivity will continue to decrease to zero. The only way to increase productivity is to prevent good code from rotting to bad code by writing clean code. It&apos;s our job to defend the code and keep it clean. The key is &quot;code-sense&quot; being able to spot bad code and transform it into clean code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code&apos;s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you&apos;re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you - code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Michael Feathers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers are the authors of their code, it&apos;s their responsiblity for communicating well with their readers. Most of the time are spent reading code instead of writing, making it easy to read should be the main focus when creating clean code. Follow the boy scout rule, leave the campground cleaner than you found it. To develop &quot;code sense&quot; by practicing the tools, techniques, and thought processes used by good programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meaningful Names&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name is everywhere in software, it&apos;s important to pick a intention-revealing name. The name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. Avoid disinformation, leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. Remember to make meaningful distinctions, be able to distinguish between variable names. Use pronounceable names so that everyone knows what you&apos;re are talking about. Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names while methods should have verb or verb phrase names. Pick one word per concept, that one word should be the same everywhere in the software. Avoid using the same word for two purposes. A professional programmer understands that clarity is king! You are the author of your story, use names that will help you tell your story to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important rule of functions is that it should be small!! This implies that the function block using if statement, else statements, while statements, and so on should be a function call. This allows you to name a descriptive function name and reduces your function size. Use the Step-down rule, a top-down narrative where every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero niladic. The more arguments you have, the more complex your function gets, we want simple and short functions! You can create functions with parameters but think carefully! Give parameter meaningful names that goes with the descriptive function name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid side effects! Your functions should only do one thing, avoid doing other hidden things. If you do have a side effect, include the side effect in the function name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function should either do something or answer something, but not both. Every function, and every block within a function, should have one entry and one exit. There should only be one return statement in a function, no break or continue statements in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master programmers writes stories rather than programs. The art of programming is and has always been, the art of language design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING, THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments are evil! They propagates lies and misinformation, code are always evolving and the comments don&apos;t always follow them. The older the comment is, the farther away it is from the code it describes. Truth can only be found in the code, only the code can truly tell you what it does. Comments can be avoided if you write clean code! You can still use comments, focus on intent and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Formatting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code formatting is imporatant along with readability of you code! Remember readability comes before functionality, the functionality of the code will always change. Readability helps with modifying the functionality, your style and discipline survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper metaphor, think of a well-written newspaper article. The top is where to have your high-level abstraction, as you go down there&apos;s more details. The end is where you will find the lowest level functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other. For example, instance variables should be declared at the top of the class. If one functions calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee. This creates a nice flow down the source code module from high level to low level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horizonal formatting limit should be around 80 to 120 characters per line. We can use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related and disassociate things that are more weakly related. Every programmer has his own formatting rules, but if he works in a team, then the team rules. Keep to the formatting style that the teams agrees upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Objects and Data Structures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables, it&apos;s about abstractions. Abstract interfaces allows its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without having to know its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions. Objects and data structure are virtual opposites!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; PI &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3.14&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; PI &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; radius &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; radius&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedual code makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structure. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structure because all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Error Handling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it&apos;s wrong. Write Try-Catch-Finally Statement first, when you run the code in the try portion, you are stating that execution can abort at any point and then resume at the catch. Create informative error message and pass them along with your exceptions. Don&apos;t return null and avoid passing null into methods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Boundaries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to control all software in our systems. This includes cleanly integrating foreign code like third-party libraries with the help of design patterns. One way can be creating a wrapper class that implements a interface that is tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the application. It&apos;s recommend to use learning tests when exploring third-party API. Code at the boundaries needs clear separation and tests that define expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s better to depend on something you control than on something you don&apos;t control, lest it end up controlling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Driven Development TDD asks us to write unit tests first, before writing any production code. The tests and the production code are written together, with the tests just a few seconds ahead of the production code. Consider the following three laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping tests clean will allow the production code to evolve. The unit tests gives the ability to make sure that changes to the code base worked as expected. Tests preserve and enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of the production code. Creating clean tests is the same as creating clean code, it follows the same practices, expect it&apos;s in a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean tests follow &lt;strong&gt;F.I.R.S.T.&lt;/strong&gt; acronym :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Tests should be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent&lt;/strong&gt;: Tests should not depend on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeatable&lt;/strong&gt;: Test should be repeatable in any environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Validating&lt;/strong&gt;: The tests should have a boolean output pass or fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timely&lt;/strong&gt;: The tests need to be written in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test code is just as important as production code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Classes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule of classes is that they should be small! With classes we count responsibilities. The name of the class should depend on the responsibility it has. The Single Responsibility Principle SRP states that classes should have one responsibility - one reason to change. We want our systems to be composed of many small classes, not a few large ones. Each small class encapsulates a single responsibility, has a single reason to change, and collaborates with a few others to achieve the desired system behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. When cohesion is high, it means that the methods and variables of the class are co-dependent and hang together as a logical whole. Maintaining cohesion results in many small classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Systems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code base is similiar to cities, teams of people who manage particular parts of the city. Some of those people are responsible for the big picture, while others focus on the details. Remember that cities works with the help of levels of abstractions and modularity. Construction is a very different process from use. Create clean systems by applying design patterns, never forget to use the simplest thing that can possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Emergence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four simple rules that will help make applying principles such as Single Responsibility Principle SRP and Dependency Injection Principle DIP easier. A testable system is important, writing simple and easy tests will make us think about better designs. Following a simple and obvious rule that says we need to have tests and run them continuously impacts our system&apos;s adherence to the primary Object Oriented OO goals of low coupling and high cohesion. Once we have a testable system, refactor to clean code. The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that cleaning up the code will break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs All the Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains no duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expresses the intent of the programmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimizes the number of classes and methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the practice of simple design can and does encourage and enable developers to adhere to good principles and patterns that otherwise takes years to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G28: Encapsulate Conditionals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G29: Avoid Negative Conditionals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G30: Functions Should Do One Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G31: Hidden Temporal Couplings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G32: Don&apos;t Be Arbitrary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G33: Encapsulate Boundary Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G34: Functions Should Descend Only One Level of Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G35: Keep Configurable Data at High Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G36: Avoid Transitive Navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J1: Avoid Long Import Lists by Using Wildcards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J2: Don&apos;t Inherit Constants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J3: Contants versus Enums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Names&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N1: Choose Descriptive Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N2: Choose Names at the Appropriate Level of Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N3: Use Standard Nomenclature Where Possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N4: Unambiguous Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N7: Names Should Describe Side-Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T1: Insufficient Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T2: Use a Coverage Tool!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T3: Don&apos;t Skip Trivial Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T4: An Ignored Test Is a Question about an Ambiguity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T5: Test Boundary Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T6: Exhaustively Test Near Bugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T8: Test Coverage Patterns Can be Revealing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T9: Tests Should be Fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. Professionalism and craftmanship come from values that drive disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoyed learning about the past when Computer Science wasn&apos;t an academic degree. A time when computers were expensive and a limited amount of people had access to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most if not all of the interviewee started programming at a young age. The languages they learned were low level like BASIC, APL, FORTRAN, LISP, and Perl to name a few. You had to keep track of memory storage since it was a limiting factor. Thanks to the Moore’s Law, these days we don&apos;t have to worry about memory storage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember learning about transistors in college, a device that represents two states. These devices are semiconductors that can be either a conductor or insulator. The combination of transistors will give us logic gates, which allows computer to perform operations. It&apos;s amazing how two states can be used to represent information and perform arithmetic operations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that most of the interviewee had access to a computer at a young age. Their parents were skilled professionals or worked at a university. They would read about coding in a magazine or book then applied what they learned. Some would take programming courses at a university, the courses were a part of Mathematics and Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I learn from the book is when picking a languages, you are picking a community. All programming languages has a user base. A community where people help each other learn. That&apos;s what makes a program language so great, the community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When debugging a program, there&apos;s many tools that can help. The print statement seem to be the best debugging tool. It&apos;s simple and easy to use. The other tools are applying break points and running the program step by step, observing the variables in memory and making sure they are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a huge emphasis on coding styles! The code should be readable! Creating clean code will increase productivity and improve maintenance. Think of the code as our house, everyone wants a clean house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book mentions ways to recognize talent. I think the best way to recognize talent isn&apos;t from doing whiteboard coding interviews. It from how passionate the individual is about programming and learning. Other skills equally important are communication and teamwork!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Seibel asked this question to all the interviewee. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Do you consider yourself a scientist, an engineer, an artist, or a craftsman?&lt;/strong&gt; The response he got from each programmer varied and was my favorite question.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Win Friends & Influence People]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fundamental Techniques in Handling People Don't criticize, condemn or complain We are all human!!

&lt;h3&gt;Don&apos;t criticize, condemn or complain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all human!! Everyone thinks differently, there&apos;s no need to criticize, condemn or complain about others. Remember people only see the world in their point of veiw and in their world they are the good guys. These actions will not makes things better and will make people hate you more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give honest and sincere appreciation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to get anybody to do anything and that is by making the other person want to do it. Human biggest urge is the &quot;the desire to be important&quot; and are craving to be appreciated. This desire to be important will make people strive to be great and giving appreciation will make them feel important. Avoid flattery!! Acknowledge others accomplishments and efforts by giving honest, sincere appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Arouse in the other person an eager want&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own wants and it differs from ours. The only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Remember that everyone thinks about themselves more than anything in the world, we can use that to our advantage. Before you persuade somebody to do something, take a moment and ask yourself: &quot;How can I make this person want to do it?&quot;. An increased tendency to think always in terms of other people&apos;s point of view, and see things from their angle will make you successful in life. A individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the working of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Make People Like You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Become genuinely interested in other people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can talk about themselves for hours!!! They all want to talk about their unique stories and what they like to do. You can learn a lot from listening to others! Next time you see someone think about all the things you might learn from listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is a no brainer a smile is worth a million dollars!! I am talking about a real smile, a smile that comes from within. There are going to be times in you life where it is hard to smile, but remember smiling brings happiness to you and others around you!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn&apos;t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remember that a person&apos;s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is important and the only way to distinguish them from others is by remembering their name. Their name is a unique identifier and it&apos;s important to everyone!! Most people don&apos;t use the time and energy to remember names, don&apos;t be those people!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a good listener is always better than being a good talker!! Everyone has their own unique stories and they all want a good listener. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talk in terms of the other person&apos;s interests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has hobbies and interests!! They will be more interested in you if you show curiosity in their hobbies and interests. We are curiosity creatures and having a diversity of knowledge will only make us more interesting to others. Remember talking in terms of the other person&apos;s interests pays off for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember everyone is important, help remind people of that! Give sincere compliments and honest appreciation to others. We are all in this together and helping each other achieve the desire to be important will bring happiness to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be right and will strive to justify that. If correcting someone will make them hate you, why would you want to do that? Never question ones intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect! Avoid arguments at all cost, there&apos;s never a winner and it will only hurt both parties sense of pride. Remember to ask yourself: &quot;What will you gain and lose from winning the argument?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,&quot; and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person&apos;s viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show respect for the other person&apos;s opinions. Never say, &quot;You&apos;re wrong.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone learns and understand things differently. We make mistakes in life, but we can learn from them. It&apos;s important to help people recognize that they might be wrong by reminding them of a common human feature of making mistakes. Never tell someone they are wrong, instead work together to find the right. By working together you can see their point of view and understand why they might see something differently. Remember there&apos;s never a wrong answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s be honest with ourselves and know that we aren&apos;t always right. Admitting that you were wrong will allow others to understand your point of view and how you thought it was right. It&apos;s ok to be wrong, no one is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fool can try and defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exualtaion to admit one&apos;s mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Begin in a friendly way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by being friendly towards others, this display of friendliness will get others to agree with you. People are more likely to cooperate with you if you work alongside with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get the other person saying &quot;yes, yes&quot; immediately&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to talk to people is not by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing and keep on emphasizing, the things on which you agree. The goal is to get the &quot;yes&quot; response, this helps in understanding each others wants and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let the other person do a great deal of the talking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s remember that people like to talk about themselves! When your friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they might feel inferior and envious. It&apos;s best to let them talk about themselves and we can be the good listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friend excel you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more faith in ideas that we discover for ourself than in the ideas of others. It&apos;s best to make suggestions and let the other person think out the conclusion. We want them to agree with us and if we give them suggestions, they can decided whether or not they agree with our idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Try honestly to see things from the other person&apos;s point of view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only see the world from our own point of view. This view is different in others, instead of viewing the world in one perceptive let&apos;s expand our view to others. Try honestly to put youself in his or her place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don&apos;t think so. Don&apos;t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be sympathetic with the other person&apos;s ideas and desires&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people you meet in your life want sympathy, give it to them, and they will love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Self-pity&apos; for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Appeal to the nobler motives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be times where both parties must compromise on an agreement. When both parties fully understand each others point of view, they will be honest and fair on an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dramatize your ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to get people to recognize your ideas is to dramatize it. Doing something out of the ordinary will get people&apos;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Throw down a challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing else works, throw down a challenge!! People love challenges, the chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with praise and honest appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call attention to people&apos;s mistakes indirectly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask question instead of giving direct orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the other person save face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be &quot;hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest&lt;/li&gt;

Like many software developer, we all strive to improve our software craftsmanship. We should treat our software development careers as a business. The services we provide to a company is our own skills and it belongs to us. Think of the company that you’re working for as a client and we&apos;re selling the service of developing software to them. Just like a company is providing products or services to their customers. The book emphasis on having a business mindset which will in turn makes us better software developers. All businesses have a goal in mind from creating a product to providing services. We as software developers should set goals to reach somewhere in our career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that if I don&apos;t have a purpose or direction, I tend to lose focus and interest. After graduating college, I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I enjoy programming and wanted to do that for a living. I didn&apos;t touch programming until my early twenties while taking an introduction to C++ at a community college. I didn&apos;t like programming in the beginning, I didn&apos;t know any jargons and was very slow at writing programs. I learned everything from reading a book called &lt;em&gt;C++ For Engineers &amp;#x26; Scientists&lt;/em&gt; Third Edition by Gary J. Bronson. This book gave me a better understanding of the programming fundamental that all languages shared. I didn&apos;t focus too much on programming, but it was something I kept seeing while attending college. MATLAB was what I learned after C++, this software is used in engineering to solve any mathematical problem. I used this software in some of my labs and started to understand how to write and read code. I started to see the big picture of creating programs that solves problems. I wanted to learn more about programming, so I took two more computer science courses at a community college. This time I learn Java, along with Object Orient Programming and Data Structures. I started to see programming differently after taking these courses. As I learn more about programming, I start to understand how computer works. One elective course I took at a university was &lt;em&gt;Computer Organization and Design&lt;/em&gt;, this was one of my favorite courses in college. Right after college I decided to focus on becoming a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book talks about setting goals and tracking them. My current goal is to become a software engineer and to constantly improve my software craftsmanship. Something I noticed while looking for jobs is that there are many technologies used in this industry. My focus is becoming a full-stack software engineer, I want to learn both the front-end and back-end in web development. The main factor in choosing this career path is that I will be a lifelong learner. I enjoy learning new technologies and solving problems. There&apos;s much to learn in software engineering that I needed a way to track my progress. The book recommend blogging as a ways to track your progress and is a great way to market yourself. I created this blog to keep track of my progress and to market myself to companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to market yourself and to build your own brand. Just like a business brand, we can create our own personal brand by picking an audience and a specialization. I didn&apos;t know anything about branding until I read the chapter &lt;em&gt;Marketing yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Creating a successful blog is one of the best mediums that a software developer can use to market themselves. A blog is a cheap and easy way to market yourself and it&apos;s the best way for getting name out there in the world. You are able to use a blog as part of your resume and for the employer to get to know who you are. I created my own blog using Jekyll and hosted it on Github. There are many ways to create a blog and I picked Jekyll because I have more control over my blog site. I started writing blogs about technologies I&apos;m currently learning and to promote active learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I learned from college apart from solving problems is learning how to learn. The book talked about whether or not you need a degree to become a software developer. My personal view on this is no. You do not need a degree in computer science to be a software developer. However I recommend getting a technical degree if you&apos;re not a self-starter. I wasn&apos;t a self-starter and while attending college I started to learn how to read textbooks. I learn how to understand theorems and how to apply them to solve problems. Obtaining a technical degree will improve your problem solving skills and keep you motivated in learning. I noticed early in my college life that I learn from reading textbooks and not from attending lectures. Most of my life I didn&apos;t like learning and was bored in school. I was the kid that struggle in school and would sleep in all my classes. The major turning point in my life was when I decided to major in Electrical Engineering. It was the best decision I ever made in my life. What I learned after college is how to continue learning on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has a chapter call &lt;em&gt;Learning how to learn: How to teach yourself&lt;/em&gt;. This is probably the most important skill that all software developer have. Learning something new can be intimidating at first. I remember that feeling while taking Calculus in college, note if I didn&apos;t pursue a technical degree I would&apos;ve avoided this subject all my life. Calculus sounds complicated and complex. I was afraid of Calculus based on what other people had said about it. Calculus is like anything you learn in life. It a subject that can be learned and it takes time to learn it. As a student that struggle in school, I avoided hard subjects. After taking Calculus I realized that learning wasn&apos;t so bad and that I was able to learn from reading the textbook and doing the exercises. What I realized now in my life is that learning can be fun and exciting. One skill I&apos;m constantly working on is becoming a quick learner, I want to be able to learn technologies quickly. The book introduce a 10 step process for learning. What I learned from this process is to learn enough to do something useful. You can spend hours reading all the resources available, instead you should filter the resources to the ones that fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how the book makes a big emphasis on teaching. I know that the only way to understand something better is to be able to teach it to others. I created this blog to improve my technical writing skills along with learning how to teach. There are many blogs out there that teaches people certain skills. I learned certain technologies from reading blogs and doing tutorials online. I started blogging about technologies I am learning to teach people what I learned. I want to improve my teaching skills and to be a great mentor. The book goes over finding a mentor and becoming a mentor which is critical in becoming a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this book unique and amazing is that it has a chapter for &lt;em&gt;Fitness&lt;/em&gt;. I have a gym membership ever since I was in high school. I enjoy going to the gym and working out, it a great way for me to relax and release stress. Over the years I tried my best to go to the gym as least four times a week. There are times where I get lazy and skip going to the gym, then I regret skipping the gym. I noticed that it&apos;s hard for me to gain mass and weight. I have the skinny genetics where I can eat anything I want without gaining any weight. Some people might think it&apos;s a good thing, but I personally want to gain weight. Fitness has always been important to me to the point of being as strong and fit as I can be. I enjoy reading this chapter that promotes fitness along with being a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was a great read. There are many things in the book that I didn&apos;t talk about and only went through some of the topics that I can relate to. This book help me understand how to enjoy life while being a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
